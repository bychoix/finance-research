Using a sample of loss firms, we compare the market reaction to announcements of non-GAAP earnings with the reaction to GAAP earnings. We find that non-GAAP earnings disclosures are incrementally informative for loss firms, particularly when they signal a potential turnaround or a more favorable underlying performance than GAAP earnings suggest. Our results suggest that investors find value in non-GAAP disclosures even when firms are reporting losses.",Does non-GAAP earnings disclosure provide incremental information for firms reporting losses?,A sample of loss firms.,Comparison of market reaction to announcements of non-GAAP earnings versus GAAP earnings.,"Non-GAAP earnings disclosures are incrementally informative for loss firms, particularly when they signal a potential turnaround or a more favorable underlying performance than GAAP earnings suggest.",Investors find value in non-GAAP disclosures even when firms are reporting losses.,False,,,False

The Role of Tacit Knowledge in Auditor Experti...,2018,Journal of Accounting Research,"Two critical aspects of the model of an auditor are the auditor's expertise and the auditor's effort. In this paper, we examine the role of tacit knowledge in auditor expertise. We define tacit knowledge as knowledge that is difficult to articulate or codify, and we hypothesize that auditors with more tacit knowledge are better able to identify and assess audit risks. We also examine the role of auditor effort in the audit process. We find that both tacit knowledge and effort are important determinants of audit quality.

Mandatory and Voluntary Disclosures: Dynamic I...,2018,Journal of Accounting Research,"Firms sometimes obtain soft private information that is not easily verifiable. This information can be valuable to investors, but firms may be reluctant to disclose it voluntarily due to concerns about litigation or competitive disadvantage. This paper examines the dynamic interaction between mandatory and voluntary disclosures of soft private information. We develop a model in which a firm chooses whether to disclose soft private information, and regulators decide whether to mandate disclosure. We find that the optimal disclosure policy depends on the informativeness of the information, the cost of disclosure, and the potential for litigation.

Zombie Board: Board Tenure and Firm Performance,2018,Journal of Accounting Research,"We show that board tenure exhibits an inverted U-shaped relationship with firm performance. Specifically, firms with very short or very long board tenure tend to perform worse than firms with moderate board tenure. We hypothesize that very short tenure is associated with a lack of experience and expertise, while very long tenure is associated with entrenchment and a lack of innovation. We find that this relationship holds after controlling for a variety of firm-specific and macroeconomic factors. Our results suggest that there is an optimal range for board tenure that maximizes firm performance.",What is the relationship between board tenure and firm performance?,Not specified in the abstract.,Not specified in the abstract.,Board tenure exhibits an inverted U-shaped relationship with firm performance.

Incorrect Inferences When Using Residuals as D...,2018,Journal of Accounting Research,"We analyze a procedure common in empirical accounting research: using residuals from a regression model as a proxy for a firm's performance. We show that this procedure can lead to incorrect inferences if the residuals are not properly accounted for. Specifically, we demonstrate that if the residuals are correlated with the variables of interest, then the estimated coefficients will be biased. We also show that this bias can be substantial, leading to incorrect conclusions about the relationships between variables.

The Real Effects of FAS 166/167 on Banks’ Mort...,2018,Journal of Accounting Research,"We examine the real effects of FAS 166/167 on banks’ mortgage lending. These standards required banks to consolidate off-balance-sheet entities, which increased their reported assets and liabilities. We hypothesize that this increase in balance sheet size would lead to a decrease in mortgage lending, as banks would face higher capital requirements. We find that banks subject to these standards did indeed reduce their mortgage lending. We also find that this reduction in lending was concentrated among banks that were more reliant on securitization.

Cross-Firm Real Earnings Management,2017,Journal of Accounting Research,"Our analysis is rooted in the notion that firms manage earnings to meet or beat benchmarks. We examine cross-firm variation in real earnings management, which involves altering real business activities, such as production or discretionary spending, to influence earnings. We hypothesize that firms with greater incentives to manage earnings, such as those facing financial distress or regulatory scrutiny, will engage in more real earnings management.

Buy-Side Analysts and Earnings Conference Calls,2017,Journal of Accounting Research,"Companies’ earnings conference calls are a key venue for disseminating information to investors. This paper examines the role of buy-side analysts in these calls. We hypothesize that buy-side analysts, due to their direct investment interests, ask more probing questions and provide more insightful commentary than sell-side analysts. We find that the presence of buy-side analysts is associated with greater information revelation during conference calls, as evidenced by longer calls, more questions asked, and more detailed responses. We also find that firms with more active buy-side analyst participation experience greater stock price informativeness. Our results highlight the value of buy-side analysts in the information dissemination process.","What is the role of buy-side analysts in earnings conference calls, and how does their participation affect information revelation and stock price informativeness?",Not specified in the abstract.,Not specified in the abstract.,The presence of buy-side analysts is associated with greater information revelation during conference calls and greater stock price informativeness.,The value of buy-side analysts in the information dissemination process.,False,,,False

This paper challenges that view by examining whether linguistic complexity can also reflect genuine complexity in the underlying business or information. We develop measures of linguistic complexity and analyze their relationship with firm characteristics and disclosure outcomes. We find that while some complex disclosures are indeed obfuscatory, others reflect the inherent complexity of the firm's operations or financial situation.

Specifically, we find that it is more costly for investors to trade on negative news than on positive news. We hypothesize that this asymmetry is due to differences in information acquisition costs and the risk aversion of market makers. We find that the asymmetric trading costs are associated with a greater tendency for stock prices to overreact to negative news.
