Should Derivatives Be Privileged in Bankruptcy?,PATRICK BOLTON,11 November 2014,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12201,"ABSTRACTDerivatives enjoy special status in bankruptcy: they are exempt from the automatic stay and effectively senior to virtually all other claims. We propose a corporate finance model to assess the effect of these exemptions on a firm's cost of borrowing and incentives to engage in derivative transactions. While derivatives are value-enhancing risk management tools, seniority for derivatives can lead to inefficiencies: it transfers credit risk to debtholders, even though this risk is borne more efficiently in the derivative market. Seniority for derivatives is efficient only if it provides sufficient cross-netting benefits to derivative counterparties that provide hedging services."
Regulatory Arbitrage and Cross-Border Bank Acquisitions,G. ANDREW KAROLYI,05 March 2015,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12262,"ABSTRACTWe study how differences in bank regulation influence cross-border bank acquisition flows and share price reactions to cross-border deal announcements. Using a sample of 7,297 domestic and 916 majority cross-border deals announced between 1995 and 2012, we find evidence of a form of “regulatory arbitrage” whereby acquisition flows involve acquirers from countries with stronger regulations than their targets. Target and aggregate abnormal returns around deal announcements are positive and larger when acquirers come from more restrictive bank regulatory environments. We interpret this evidence as more consistent with a benign form of regulatory arbitrage than a potentially destructive one."
Risk Overhang and Loan Portfolio Decisions: Small Business Loan Supply before and during the Financial Crisis,ROBERT DEYOUNG,04 September 2015,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12356,"ABSTRACTWe estimate a structural model of bank portfolio lending and find that the typical U.S. community bank reduced its business lending during the global financial crisis. The decline in business credit was driven by increased risk overhang effects (consistent with a reduction in the liquidity of assets held on bank balance sheets) and by reduced loan supply elasticities suggestive of credit rationing (consistent with an increase in lender risk aversion). Nevertheless, we identify a group of strategically focused relationship banks that made and maintained higher levels of business loans during the crisis."
"Is Historical Cost Accounting a Panacea? Market Stress, Incentive Distortions, and Gains Trading",ANDREW ELLUL,04 September 2015,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12357,"ABSTRACTAccounting rules, through their interactions with capital regulations, affect financial institutions’ trading behavior. The insurance industry provides a laboratory to explore these interactions: life insurers have greater flexibility than property and casualty insurers to hold speculative-grade assets at historical cost, and the degree to which life insurers recognize market values differs across U.S. states. During the financial crisis, insurers facing a lesser degree of market value recognition are less likely to sell downgraded asset-backed securities. To improve their capital positions, these insurers disproportionately resort to gains trading, selectively selling otherwise unrelated bonds with high unrealized gains, transmitting shocks across markets."

Internal Capital Markets in Business Groups: Evidence from the Asian Financial Crisis

"Foreclosures, House Prices, and the Real Economy",ATIF MIAN,07 August 2015,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12310,"ABSTRACTFrom 2007 to 2009, states without a judicial requirement for foreclosures weretwiceas likely to foreclose on delinquent homeowners. Analysis of borders of states with differing foreclosure laws reveals a discrete jump in foreclosure propensity as one enters nonjudicial states. Using state judicial requirement as an instrument for foreclosures, we show that foreclosures led to a large decline in house prices, residential investment, and consumer demand from 2007 to 2009. As foreclosures subsided from 2011 to 2013, the foreclosure rates in nonjudicial and judicial requirement states converged and we find some evidence of a stronger recovery in nonjudicial states."
Asset Quality Misrepresentation by Financial Intermediaries: Evidence from the RMBS Market,TOMASZ PISKORSKI,18 March 2015,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12271,"ABSTRACTWe document that contractual disclosures by intermediaries during the sale of mortgages contained false information about the borrower's housing equity in 7–14% of loans. The rate of misrepresented loan default was 70% higher than for similar loans. These misrepresentations likely occurred late in the intermediation and exist among securities sold by all reputable intermediaries. Investors—including large institutions—holding securities with misrepresented collateral suffered severe losses due to loan defaults, price declines, and ratings downgrades. Pools with misrepresentations were not issued at a discount. Misrepresentation on another easy-to-quantify dimension shows that these effects are a conservative lower bound."
The People in Your Neighborhood: Social Interactions and Mutual Fund Portfolios,VERONIKA K. POOL,02 September 2014,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12208,"ABSTRACTWe find that socially connected fund managers have more similar holdings and trades. The overlap of funds whose managers reside in the same neighborhood is considerably higher than that of funds whose managers live in the same city but in different neighborhoods. These effects are larger when managers share a similar ethnic background, and are not explained by preferences. Valuable information is transmitted through these peer networks: a long-short strategy composed of stocks purchased minus sold by neighboring managers delivers positive risk-adjusted returns. Unlike prior empirical work, our tests disentangle the effects of social interactions from community effects."
"Mandatory Portfolio Disclosure, Stock Liquidity, and Mutual Fund Performance",VIKAS AGARWAL,27 January 2015,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12245,"ABSTRACTWe examine the impact of mandatory portfolio disclosure by mutual funds on stock liquidity and fund performance. We develop a model of informed trading with disclosure and test its predictions using the May 2004 SEC regulation requiring more frequent disclosure. Stocks with higher fund ownership, especially those held by more informed funds or subject to greater information asymmetry, experience larger increases in liquidity after the regulation change. More informed funds, especially those holding stocks with greater information asymmetry, experience greater performance deterioration after the regulation change. Overall, mandatory disclosure improves stock liquidity but imposes costs on informed investors."
Government Intervention and Information Aggregation by Prices,PHILIP BOND,17 June 2015,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12303,"ABSTRACTGovernments intervene in firms' lives in a variety of ways. To enhance the efficiency of government intervention, many researchers and policy makers call for governments to make use of information contained in stock market prices. However, price informativeness is endogenous to government policy. We analyze government policy in light of this endogeneity. In some cases, it is optimal for a government to commit to limit its reliance on market prices to avoid harming the aggregation of information into market prices. For similar reasons, it is optimal for a government to limit transparency in some dimensions."
CEO Preferences and Acquisitions,DIRK JENTER,01 May 2015,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12283,"ABSTRACTThis paper explores the impact of target CEOs’ retirement preferences on takeovers. Using retirement age as a proxy for CEOs’ private merger costs, we find strong evidence that target CEOs’ preferences affect merger activity. The likelihood of receiving a successful takeover bid is sharply higher when target CEOs are close to age 65. Takeover premiums and target announcement returns are similar for retirement-age and younger CEOs, implying that retirement-age CEOs increase firm sales without sacrificing premiums. Better corporate governance is associated with more acquisitions of firms led by young CEOs, and with a smaller increase in deals at retirement age."
The Wall Street Walk when Blockholders Compete for Flows,AMIL DASGUPTA,06 August 2015,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12308,"ABSTRACTEffective monitoring by equity blockholders is important for good corporate governance. A prominent theoretical literature argues that the threat of block sale (“exit”) can be an effective governance mechanism. Many blockholders are money managers. We show that, when money managers compete for investor capital, the threat of exit loses credibility, weakening its governance role. Money managers with more skin in the game will govern more successfully using exit. Allowing funds to engage in activist measures (“voice”) does not alter our qualitative results. Our results link widely prevalent incentives in the ever-expanding money management industry to the nature of corporate governance."

Reaching for Yield in the Bond Market,BO BECKER,06 August 2014,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12199,"ABSTRACTThis paper studies reaching for yield—investors’ propensity to buy riskier assets to achieve higher yields—in the corporate bond market. We show that insurance companies reach for yield in choosing their investments. Consistent with lower rated bonds bearing higher capital requirements, insurance firms prefer to hold higher rated bonds. However, conditional on credit ratings, insurance portfolios are systematically biased toward higher yield, higher CDS bonds. This behavior is related to the business cycle being most pronounced during economic expansions. It is also characteristic of firms with poor corporate governance and for which the regulatory capital requirement is more binding."
Arbitrage Asymmetry and the Idiosyncratic Volatility Puzzle,ROBERT F. STAMBAUGH,01 May 2015,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12286,"ABSTRACTBuying is easier than shorting for many equity investors. Combining this arbitrage asymmetry with the arbitrage risk represented by idiosyncratic volatility (IVOL) explains the negative relation between IVOL and average return. The IVOL-return relation is negative among overpriced stocks but positive among underpriced stocks, with mispricing determined by combining 11 return anomalies. Consistent with arbitrage asymmetry, the negative relation among overpriced stocks is stronger, especially for stocks less easily shorted, so the overall IVOL-return relation is negative. Further supporting our explanation, high investor sentiment weakens the positive relation among underpriced stocks and, especially, strengthens the negative relation among overpriced stocks."
Wall Street Occupations,ULF AXELSON,03 February 2015,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12244,"ABSTRACTMany finance jobs entail the risk of large losses, and hard-to-monitor effort. We analyze the equilibrium consequences of these features in a model with optimal dynamic contracting. We show that finance jobs feature high compensation, up-or-out promotion, and long work hours, and are more attractive than other jobs. Moral hazard problems are exacerbated in booms, even though pay increases. Employees whose talent would be more valuable elsewhere can be lured into finance jobs, while the most talented employees might be unable to land these jobs because they are “too hard to manage.”"
"Market Making Contracts, Firm Value, and the IPO Decision",HENDRIK BESSEMBINDER,12 May 2015,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12285,"ABSTRACTWe examine the effects of secondary market liquidity on firm value and the IPO decision. Competitive aftermarket liquidity provision is associated with reduced welfare and a discounted secondary market price that can dissuade IPOs. The competitive market fails in particular for firms or at times when uncertainty regarding fundamental value and asymmetric information are large in combination. In these cases, firm value and welfare are improved by a contract where the firm engages a designated market maker to enhance liquidity. Such contracts represent a market solution to a market imperfection, particularly for small, growth firms."
Asymmetric Learning from Financial Information,CAMELIA M. KUHNEN,27 October 2014,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12223,ABSTRACTThis study asks whether investors learn differently from gains versus losses. I find experimental evidence that indicates that being in the negative domain leads individuals to form overly pessimistic beliefs about available investment options. This pessimism bias is driven by people reacting more to low outcomes in the negative domain relative to the positive domain. Such asymmetric learning may help explain documented empirical patterns regarding the differential role of poor versus good economic conditions on investment behavior and household economic choices.
Informational Frictions and Commodity Markets,MICHAEL SOCKIN,09 March 2015,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12261,"ABSTRACTThis paper develops a model with a tractable log-linear equilibrium to analyze the effects of informational frictions in commodity markets. By aggregating dispersed information about the strength of the global economy among goods producers whose production has complementarity, commodity prices serve as price signals to guide producers' production decisions and commodity demand. Our model highlights important feedback effects of informational noise originating from supply shocks and futures market trading on commodity demand and spot prices. Our analysis illustrates the weakness common in empirical studies on commodity markets of assuming that different types of shocks are publicly observable to market participants."
The Beauty Contest and Short-Term Trading,GIOVANNI CESPA,01 May 2015,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12279,"ABSTRACTShort-termism need not breed informational price inefficiency even when generating beauty contests. We demonstrate this claim in a two-period market with persistent liquidity trading and risk-averse, privately informed, short-term investors and find that prices reflect average expectations about fundamentals and liquidity trading. Informed investors engage in “retrospective” learning to reassess inferences (about fundamentals) made during the trading game's early stages. This behavior introduces strategic complementarities in the use of information and can yield twostableequilibria that can be ranked in terms of liquidity, volatility, and informational efficiency. We derive implications that explain market anomalies as well as empirical regularities."
CEO Turnover and Relative Performance Evaluation,DIRK JENTER,01 May 2015,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12282,"ABSTRACTThis paper shows that CEOs are fired after bad firm performance caused by factors beyond their control. Standard economic theory predicts that corporate boards filter out exogenous industry and market shocks from firm performance before deciding on CEO retention. Using a hand-collected sample of 3,365 CEO turnovers from 1993 to 2009, we document that CEOs are significantly more likely to be dismissed from their jobs after bad industry and, to a lesser extent, after bad market performance. A decline in industry performance from the 90thto the 10thpercentile doubles the probability of a forced CEO turnover."
The Cost of Capital for Alternative Investments,JAKUB W. JUREK,18 March 2015,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12269,"ABSTRACTTraditional risk factor models indicate that hedge funds capture pre-fee alphas of 6% to 10% per annum over the period from 1996 to 2012. At the same time, the hedge fund return series is not reliably distinguishable from the returns of mechanical S&P 500 put-writing strategies. We show that the high excess returns to hedge funds and put-writing are consistent with an equilibrium in which a small subset of investors specialize in bearing downside market risks. Required rates of return in such an equilibrium can dramatically exceed those suggested by traditional models, affecting inference about the attractiveness of these investments."
Hidden Liquidity: Some New Light on Dark Trading,ROBERT BLOOMFIELD,20 May 2015,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12301,"ABSTRACTUsing a laboratory market, we investigate how the ability to hide orders affects traders’ strategies and market outcomes in a limit order book environment. We find that order strategies are greatly affected by allowing hidden liquidity, with traders substituting nondisplayed for displayed shares and changing the aggressiveness of their trading. As traders adapt their behavior to the different opacity regimes, however, most aggregate market outcomes (such as liquidity and informational efficiency) are not affected as much. We also find that opacity appears to increase the profits of informed traders but only when their private information is very valuable."
Outsourcing in the International Mutual Fund Industry: An Equilibrium View,OLEG CHUPRININ,05 March 2015,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12259,"ABSTRACTWe study outsourcing relationships among international asset management firms. We find that, in companies that manage both outsourced and in-house funds, in-house funds outperform outsourced funds by 0.85% annually (57% of the expense ratio). We attribute this result to preferential treatment of in-house funds via the preferential allocation of IPOs, trading opportunities, and cross-trades, especially at times when in-house funds face steep outflows and require liquidity. We explain preferential treatment with agency problems: it increases with the subcontractor's market power and the difficulty of monitoring the subcontractor, and decreases with the subcontractor's amount of parallel in-house activity."
The Role of Institutional Investors in Voting: Evidence from the Securities Lending Market,REENA AGGARWAL,01 May 2015,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12284,"ABSTRACTThis paper investigates voting preferences of institutional investors using the unique setting of the securities lending market. Investors restrict lendable supply and/or recall loaned shares prior to the proxy record date to exercise voting rights. Recall is higher for investors with greater incentives to monitor, for firms with poor performance or weak governance, and for proposals where returns to governance are likely higher. At the subsequent vote, recall is associated with less support for management and more support for shareholder proposals. Our results indicate that institutions value their vote and use the proxy process to affect corporate governance."

Presidential Address: Does Finance Benefit Society?,LUIGI ZINGALES,23 July 2015,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12295,"ABSTRACTAcademics’ view of the benefits of finance vastly exceeds societal perception. This dissonance is at least partly explained by an underappreciation by academia of how, without proper rules, finance can easily degenerate into a rent-seeking activity. I outline what finance academics can do, from a research point of view and from an educational point of view, to promote good finance and minimize the bad."
Does Going Public Affect Innovation?,SHAI BERNSTEIN,13 April 2015,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12275,"ABSTRACTThis paper investigates the effects of going public on innovation by comparing the innovation activity of firms that go public with firms that withdraw their initial public offering (IPO) filing and remain private. NASDAQ fluctuations during the book-building phase are used as an instrument for IPO completion. Using patent-based metrics, I find that the quality of internal innovation declines following the IPO, and firms experience both an exodus of skilled inventors and a decline in the productivity of the remaining inventors. However, public firms attract new human capital and acquire external innovation. The analysis reveals that going public changes firms' strategies in pursuing innovation."
The Value of Control and the Costs of Illiquidity,RUI ALBUQUERQUE,02 September 2014,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12207,"ABSTRACTWe develop a search model of block trades that values the illiquidity of controlling stakes. The model considers several dimensions of illiquidity. First, following a liquidity shock, the controlling blockholder is forced to sell, possibly to a less efficient acquirer. Second, this sale may occur at a fire sale price. Third, absent a liquidity shock, a trade occurs only if a potential buyer arrives. Using a structural estimation approach and U.S. data on trades of controlling blocks of public corporations, we estimate the value of control, blockholders' marketability discount, and dispersed shareholders' illiquidity-spillover discount."
The Impact of Incentives and Communication Costs on Information Production and Use: Evidence from Bank Lending,JUN (QJ) QIAN,06 February 2015,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12251,"ABSTRACTIn 2002 and 2003, many Chinese banks implemented reforms that delegated authority to individual loan officers. The change followed China's entrance into the WTO and offers a plausibly exogenous shock to loan officer incentives to produce information. We find that the bank's internal risk rating becomes a stronger predictor of loan interest rates and ex post outcomes after reform. When the loan officer and the branch president who approves the loan work together longer, the rating also becomes more strongly related to loan prices and outcomes. Our results highlight how incentives and communication costs affect information production and use."
A Model of Mortgage Default,JOHN Y. CAMPBELL,06 February 2015,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12252,"ABSTRACTIn this paper, we solve a dynamic model of households' mortgage decisions incorporating labor income, house price, inflation, and interest rate risk. Using a zero-profit condition for mortgage lenders, we solve for equilibrium mortgage rates given borrower characteristics and optimal decisions. The model quantifies the effects of adjustable versus fixed mortgage rates, loan-to-value ratios, and mortgage affordability measures on mortgage premia and default. Mortgage selection by heterogeneous borrowers helps explain the higher default rates on adjustable-rate mortgages during the recent U.S. housing downturn, and the variation in mortgage premia with the level of interest rates."
Do Prices Reveal the Presence of Informed Trading?,PIERRE COLLIN-DUFRESNE,09 March 2015,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12260,"ABSTRACTUsing a comprehensive sample of trades from Schedule 13D filings by activist investors, we study how measures of adverse selection respond to informed trading. We find that on days when activists accumulate shares, measures of adverse selection and of stock illiquidity are lower, even though prices are positively impacted. Two channels help explain this phenomenon: (1) activists select times of higher liquidity when they trade, and (2) activists use limit orders. We conclude that, when informed traders can select when and how to trade, standard measures of adverse selection may fail to capture the presence of informed trading."
Investment Decisions of Nonprofit Firms: Evidence from Hospitals,MANUEL ADELINO,24 November 2014,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12234,"ABSTRACTThis paper examines investment choices of nonprofit hospitals. It tests how shocks to cash flows caused by the performance of the hospitals’ financial assets affect hospital expenditures. Capital expenditures increase, on average, by 10 to 28 cents for every dollar received from financial assets. The sensitivity is similar to that found earlier for shareholder-owned corporations. Executive compensation, other salaries, and perks do not respond significantly to cash flow shocks. Hospitals with an apparent tendency to overspend on medical procedures do not exhibit higher investment-cash flow sensitivities. The sensitivities are higher for hospitals that appear financially constrained."
The Brain Gain of Corporate Boards: Evidence from China,MARIASSUNTA GIANNETTI,06 August 2014,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12198,"ABSTRACTWe study the impact of directors with foreign experience on firm performance in emerging markets. Using a unique data set from China, we exploit the introduction of policies to attract talented emigrants and increase the supply of individuals with foreign experience in different provinces at different times. We document that performance increases after firms hire directors with foreign experience and identify the channels through which the emigration of talent may lead to a brain gain. Our findings provide evidence on how directors transmit knowledge about management practices and corporate governance to firms in emerging markets."
A Comparative-Advantage Approach to Government Debt Maturity,ROBIN GREENWOOD,06 February 2015,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12253,"ABSTRACTWe study optimal government debt maturity in a model where investors derive monetary services from holding riskless short-term securities. In a setting where the government is the only issuer of such riskless paper, it trades off the monetary premium associated with short-term debt against the refinancing risk implied by the need to roll over its debt more often. We extend the model to allow private financial intermediaries to compete with the government in the provision of short-term money-like claims. We argue that, if there are negative externalities associated with private money creation, the government should tilt its issuance more toward short maturities, thereby partially crowding out the private sector's use of short-term debt."
Information Diversity and Complementarities in Trading and Information Acquisition,ITAY GOLDSTEIN,02 December 2014,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12226,"ABSTRACTWe analyze a model in which different traders are informed of different fundamentals that affect the security value. We identify a source for strategic complementarities in trading and information acquisition: aggressive trading on information about one fundamental reduces uncertainty in trading on information about the other fundamental, encouraging more trading and information acquisition on that fundamental. This tends to amplify the effect of exogenous changes in the underlying information environment. Due to complementarities, greater diversity of information in the economy improves price informativeness. We discuss the relation between our model and recent financial phenomena and derive testable empirical implications."
Capital and Labor Reallocation within Firms,XAVIER GIROUD,06 February 2015,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12254,"ABSTRACTWe document how a positive shock to investment opportunities at one plant (“treated plant”) spills over to other plants within the same firm, but only if the firm is financially constrained. To provide the treated plant with resources, the firm's headquarters withdraws capital and labor from other plants, especially plants that are relatively less productive, not part of the firm's core industries, and located far away from headquarters. As a result of the resource reallocation, aggregate firm-wide productivity increases. We do not find evidence of capital or labor spillovers among plants of financially unconstrained firms."
Transparency in the Financial System: Rollover Risk and Crises,MATTHIEU BOUVARD,18 March 2015,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12270,"ABSTRACTWe present a theory of optimal transparency when banks are exposed to rollover risk. Disclosing bank-specific information enhances the stability of the financial system during crises, but has a destabilizing effect in normal economic times. Thus, the regulator optimally increases transparency during crises. Under this policy, however, information disclosure signals a deterioration of economic fundamentals, which gives the regulator ex post incentives to withhold information. This commitment problem precludes a disclosure policy that provides ex ante optimal insurance against aggregate shocks, and can result in excess opacity that increases the likelihood of a systemic crisis."

Change You Can Believe In? Hedge Fund Data Revisions: Erratum,ANDREW J. PATTON,23 July 2015,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12306,
Rewarding Trading Skills without Inducing Gambling,IGOR MAKAROV,24 February 2015,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12257,"ABSTRACTThis paper develops a model of active asset management in which fund managers may forgo alpha-generating strategies, preferring instead to make negative-alpha trades that enable them to temporarily manipulate investors' perceptions of their skills. We show that such trades are optimally generated by taking on hidden tail risk, and are more likely to occur when fund managers are impatient and when their trading skills are scalable, and generate a high profit per unit of risk. We propose long-term contracts that deter this behavior by dynamically adjusting the dates on which the manager is compensated in response to her cumulative performance."
Change You Can Believe In? Hedge Fund Data Revisions,ANDREW J. PATTON,27 January 2015,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12240,"ABSTRACTWe analyze the reliability of voluntary disclosures of financial information, focusing on widely-employed publicly-available hedge fund databases. Tracking changes to statements of historical performance recorded between 2007 and 2011, we find that historical returns are routinely revised. These revisions are not merely random or corrections of earlier mistakes; they are partly forecastable by fund characteristics. Funds that revise their performance histories significantly and predictably underperform those that have never revised, suggesting that unreliable disclosures constitute a valuable source of information for investors. These results speak to current debates about mandatory disclosures by financial institutions to market regulators."
"Innovation, Growth, and Asset Prices",HOWARD KUNG,27 January 2015,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12241,"ABSTRACTWe examine the asset pricing implications of a production economy whose long-term growth prospects are endogenously determined by innovation and R&D. In equilibrium, R&D endogenously drives a small, persistent component in productivity that generates long-run uncertainty about economic growth. With recursive preferences, households fear that persistent downturns in economic growth are accompanied by low asset valuations and command high-risk premia in asset markets. Empirically, we find substantial evidence for innovation-driven low-frequency movements in aggregate growth rates and asset market valuations. In short, equilibrium growth is risky."
Anchoring on Credit Spreads,CASEY DOUGAL,04 February 2015,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12248,"ABSTRACTThis paper documents that thepathof credit spreads since a firm's last loan influences thelevelat which it can currently borrow. If spreads have moved in the firm's favor (i.e., declined), it is charged a higher interest rate than is justified by current fundamentals, whereas if spreads have moved to the firm's detriment, it is charged a lower rate. We evaluate several possible explanations for this finding, and conclude that anchoring to past deal terms is most plausible."
Is a VC Partnership Greater Than the Sum of Its Partners?,MICHAEL EWENS,06 February 2015,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12249,"ABSTRACTThis paper investigates whether individual venture capitalists have repeatable investment skill and the extent to which their skill is impacted by the venture capital (VC) firm where they work. We examine a unique data set that tracks the performance of individual venture capitalists' investments over time and as they move between firms. We find evidence of skill and exit style differences even among venture partners investing at the same VC firm at the same time. Furthermore, our estimates suggest the partners' human capital is two to five times more important than the VC firm's organizational capital in explaining performance."
Dividend Dynamics and the Term Structure of Dividend Strips,FREDERICO BELO,27 January 2015,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12242,"ABSTRACTMany leading asset pricing models are specified so that the term structure of dividend volatility is either flat or upward sloping. These models predict that the term structures of expected returns and volatilities on dividend strips (i.e., claims to dividends paid over a prespecified interval) are also upward sloping. However, the empirical evidence suggests otherwise. This discrepancy can be reconciled if these models replace their proposed dividend dynamics with processes that generate stationary leverage ratios. Under such policies, shareholders are forced to divest (invest) when leverage is low (high), which shifts risk from long- to short-horizon dividend strips."
The Effect of Providing Peer Information on Retirement Savings Decisions,JOHN BESHEARS,24 February 2015,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12258,"ABSTRACTUsing a field experiment in a 401(k) plan, we measure the effect of disseminating information about peer behavior on savings. Low-saving employees received simplified plan enrollment or contribution increase forms. A randomized subset of forms stated the fraction of age-matched coworkers participating in the plan or age-matched participants contributing at least 6% of pay to the plan. We document an oppositional reaction: the presence of peer informationdecreasedthe savings of nonparticipants who were ineligible for 401(k) automatic enrollment, and higher observed peer savings rates also decreased savings. Discouragement from upward social comparisons seems to drive this reaction."
CEO Connectedness and Corporate Fraud,VIKRAMADITYA KHANNA,27 January 2015,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12243,"ABSTRACTWe find that connections CEOs develop with top executives and directors through their appointment decisions increase the risk of corporate fraud. Appointment-based CEO connectedness in executive suites and boardrooms increases the likelihood of committing fraud and decreases the likelihood of detection. Additionally, it decreases the expected costs of fraud by helping conceal fraudulent activity, making CEO dismissal less likely upon discovery, and lowering the coordination costs of carrying out illegal activity. Connections based on network ties through past employment, education, or social organization memberships have insignificant effects on fraud. Appointment-based CEO connectedness warrants attention from regulators, investors, and corporate governance specialists."
The WACC Fallacy: The Real Effects of Using a Unique Discount Rate,PHILIPP KRÜGER,06 February 2015,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12250,"ABSTRACTIn this paper, we test whether firms properly adjust for risk in their capital budgeting decisions. If managers use a single discount rate within firms, we expect that conglomerates underinvest (overinvest) in relatively safe (risky) divisions. We measure division relative risk as the difference between the division's asset beta and a firm-wide beta. We establish a robust and significant positive relationship between division-level investment and division relative risk. Next, we measure the value loss due to this behavior in the context of acquisitions. When the bidder's beta is lower than that of the target, announcement returns are significantly lower."
Corporate Taxes and Securitization,JOONGHO HAN,27 March 2014,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12157,"ABSTRACTMost banks pay corporate income taxes, but securitization vehicles do not. Our model shows that, when a bank faces strong loan demand but limited deposit market power, this tax asymmetry creates an incentive to sell loans despite less-efficient screening and monitoring of sold loans. Moreover, loan-selling increases as a bank's corporate income tax rate and capital requirement rise. Our empirical tests show that U.S. commercial banks sell more of their mortgages when they operate in states that impose higher corporate income taxes. A policy implication is that tax-induced loan-selling will rise if banks’ required equity capital increases."
How Does Household Portfolio Diversification Vary with Financial Literacy and Financial Advice?,HANS-MARTIN VON GAUDECKER,24 November 2014,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12231,"ABSTRACTHousehold investment mistakes are an important concern for researchers and policymakers alike. Portfolio underdiversification ranks among those mistakes that are potentially most costly. However, its roots and empirical importance are poorly understood. I estimate quantitatively meaningful diversification statistics and investigate their relationship with key variables. Nearly all households that score high on financial literacy or rely on professionals or private contacts for advice achieve reasonable investment outcomes. Compared to these groups, households with below-median financial literacy that trust their own decision-making capabilities lose an expected 50 bps on average. All group differences stem from the top of the loss distribution."
Subsidizing Liquidity: The Impact of Make/Take Fees on Market Quality,KATYA MALINOVA,02 December 2014,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12230,"ABSTRACTFacing increased competition over the last decade, many stock exchanges changed their trading fees to maker-taker pricing, an incentive scheme that rewards liquidity suppliers and charges liquidity demanders. Using a change in trading fees on the Toronto Stock Exchange, we study whether and why the breakdown of trading fees between liquidity demanders and suppliers matters. Posted quotes adjust after the change in fee composition, but the transaction costs for liquidity demanders remain unaffected once fees are taken into account. However, as posted bid-ask spreads decline, traders (particularly retail) use aggressive orders more frequently, and adverse selection costs decrease."
Incentivizing Calculated Risk-Taking: Evidence from an Experiment with Commercial Bank Loan Officers,SHAWN COLE,24 November 2014,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12233,"ABSTRACTWe conduct an experiment with commercial bank loan officers to test how performance compensation affects risk assessment and lending. High-powered incentives lead to greater screening effort and more profitable lending decisions. This effect is muted, however, by deferred compensation and limited liability, two standard features of loan officer compensation contracts. We find that career concerns and personality traits affect loan officer behavior, but show that the response to incentives does not vary with traits such as risk-aversion, optimism, or overconfidence. Finally, we present evidence that incentives distort the assessment of credit risk, even among professionals with many years of experience."
Aggregate Jump and Volatility Risk in the Cross-Section of Stock Returns,MARTIJN CREMERS,27 October 2014,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12220,"ABSTRACTWe examine the pricing of both aggregate jump and volatility risk in the cross-section of stock returns by constructing investable option trading strategies that load on one factor but are orthogonal to the other. Both aggregate jump and volatility risk help explain variation in expected returns. Consistent with theory, stocks with high sensitivities to jump and volatility risk have low expected returns. Both can be measured separately and are important economically, with a two-standard-deviation increase in jump (volatility) factor loadings associated with a 3.5% to 5.1% (2.7% to 2.9%) drop in expected annual stock returns."
The Recovery Theorem,STEVE ROSS,12 August 2013,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12092,"ABSTRACTWe can only estimate the distribution of stock returns, but from option prices we observe the distribution of state prices. State prices are the product of risk aversion—the pricing kernel—and the natural probability distribution. The Recovery Theorem enables us to separate these to determine the market's forecast of returns and risk aversion from state prices alone. Among other things, this allows us to recover the pricing kernel, market risk premium, and probability of a catastrophe and to construct model-free tests of the efficient market hypothesis."
The Effect of Succession Taxes on Family Firm Investment: Evidence from a Natural Experiment,MARGARITA TSOUTSOURA,06 November 2014,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12224,"ABSTRACTThis paper provides causal evidence on the impact of succession taxes on firm investment decisions and transfer of control. Using a 2002 policy change in Greece that substantially reduced the tax on intrafamily transfers of businesses, I show that succession taxes lead to a more than 40% decline in investment around family successions, slow sales growth, and a depletion of cash reserves. Furthermore, succession taxes strongly affect the decision to sell or retain the firm within the family. I conclude by discussing implications of my findings for firms in the United States and Europe."
Subprime Mortgage Defaults and Credit Default Swaps,ERIC ARENTSEN,27 October 2014,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12221,"ABSTRACTWe offer the first empirical evidence on the adverse effect of credit default swap (CDS) coverage on subprime mortgage defaults. Using a large database of privately securitized mortgages, we find that higher defaults concentrate in mortgage pools with concurrent CDS coverage, and within these pools the loans originated after or shortly before the start of CDS coverage have an even higher delinquency rate. The results are robust across zip code and origination quarter cohorts. Overall, we show that CDS coverage helped drive higher mortgage defaults during the financial crisis."
Size Anomalies in U.S. Bank Stock Returns,PRIYANK GANDHI,05 December 2014,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12235,"ABSTRACTThe largest commercial bank stocks, ranked by total size of the balance sheet, have significantly lower risk-adjusted returns than small- and medium-sized bank stocks, even though large banks are significantly more levered. We uncover a size factor in the component of bank returns that is orthogonal to the standard risk factors, including small minus big, which has the right covariance with bank returns to explain the average risk-adjusted returns. This factor measures size-dependent exposure to bank-specific tail risk. These findings are consistent with government guarantees that protect shareholders of large banks, but not small banks, in disaster states."
Estimating Oil Risk Factors Using Information from Equity and Derivatives Markets,I-HSUAN ETHAN CHIANG,28 October 2014,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12222,"ABSTRACTWe introduce a novel approach to estimating latent oil risk factors and establish their significance in pricing nonoil securities. Our model, which features four factors with simple economic interpretations, is estimated using both derivative prices and oil-related equity returns. The fit is excellent in and out of sample. The extracted oil factors carry significant risk premia, and are significantly related to macroeconomic variables as well as portfolio returns sorted on characteristics and industry. The average nonoil portfolio exhibits a sensitivity to the oil factors amounting to a sixth (in magnitude) of that of the oil industry itself."
Defined Contribution Pension Plans: Sticky or Discerning Money?,CLEMENS SIALM,24 November 2014,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12232,"ABSTRACTParticipants in defined contribution (DC) retirement plans rarely adjust their portfolio allocations, suggesting that their investment choices and consequent money flows are sticky and not discerning. However, participants’ inertia could be offset by DC plan sponsors, who adjust the plan's investment options. We examine these countervailing influences on flows into U.S. mutual funds. We find that flows into funds from DC assets are more volatile and exhibit more performance sensitivity than non-DC flows, primarily due to adjustments to the investment options by the plan sponsors. Thus, DC retirement money is less sticky and more discerning than non-DC money."
Yesterday's Heroes: Compensation and Risk at Financial Firms,ING-HAW CHENG,06 November 2014,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12225,"ABSTRACTMany believe that compensation, misaligned from shareholders’ value due to managerial entrenchment, caused financial firms to take risks before the financial crisis of 2008. We argue that, even in a classical principal-agent setting without entrenchment and with exogenous firm risk, riskier firms may offer higher total pay as compensation for the extra risk in equity stakes borne by risk-averse managers. Using long lags of stock price risk to capture exogenous firm risk, we confirm our conjecture and show that riskier firms are also more productive and more likely to be held by institutional investors, who are most able to influence compensation."
On the Design of Contingent Capital with a Market Trigger,SURESH SUNDARESAN,01 March 2014,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12134,"ABSTRACTContingent capital (CC), which aims to internalize the costs of too-big-to-fail in the capital structure of large banks, has been under intense debate by policy makers and academics. We show that CC with a market trigger, in which direct stakeholders are unable to choose optimal conversion policies, does not lead to a unique competitive equilibrium unless value transfer at conversion is not expected ex ante. The “no value transfer” restriction precludes penalizing bank managers for taking excessive risk. Multiplicity or absence of equilibrium introduces the potential for price uncertainty, market manipulation, inefficient capital allocation, and frequent conversion errors."
A Crisis of Banks as Liquidity Providers,VIRAL V. ACHARYA,02 June 2014,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12182,"ABSTRACTCan banks maintain their advantage as liquidity providers when exposed to a financial crisis? While banks honored credit lines drawn by firms during the 2007 to 2009 crisis, this liquidity provision was only possible because of explicit, large support from the government and government-sponsored agencies. At the onset of the crisis, aggregate deposit inflows into banks weakened and their loan-to-deposit shortfalls widened. These patterns were pronounced at banks with greater undrawn commitments. Such banks sought to attract deposits by offering higher rates, but the resulting private funding was insufficient to cover shortfalls and they reduced new credit."
Taxes and Corporate Policies: Evidence from a Quasi Natural Experiment,CRAIG DOIDGE,17 September 2013,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12101,"ABSTRACTWe document important interactions between tax incentives and corporate policies using a “quasi natural experiment” provided by a surprise announcement that imposed corporate taxes on a group of Canadian publicly traded firms. The announcement caused a dramatic decrease in value. Prospective tax shields partially offset the losses, adding 4.6% to firm value on average, and vary with the tax status of the marginal investor. Further, firms adjust leverage, payout, cash holdings, and investment in response to changing tax incentives. Overall, the event study and time series evidence supports the view that taxes are important for corporate decision making."
Money Doctors,NICOLA GENNAIOLI,03 July 2014,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12188,"ABSTRACTWe present a new model of investors delegating portfolio management to professionals based on trust. Trust in the manager reduces an investor's perception of the riskiness of a given investment, and allows managers to charge fees. Money managers compete for investor funds by setting fees, but because of trust, fees do not fall to costs. In equilibrium, fees are higher for assets with higher expected return, managers on average underperform the market net of fees, but investors nevertheless prefer to hire managers to investing on their own. When investors hold biased expectations, trust causes managers to pander to investor beliefs."
Inflation Risk in Corporate Bonds,JOHNNY KANG,06 August 2014,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12195,"ABSTRACTWe argue that corporate bond yields reflect fears of debt deflation. When debt is nominal, unexpectedly low inflation increases real liabilities and default risk. In a real business cycle model with optimal but infrequent capital structure choice, more uncertain or procyclical inflation leads to quantitatively important increases in corporate log yields in excess of default-free log yields. A panel of credit spread indexes from six developed countries shows that credit spreads rise by 14 basis points if inflation volatility or the inflation-stock correlation increases by one standard deviation."
Urban Vibrancy and Corporate Growth,CASEY DOUGAL,17 September 2014,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12215,"ABSTRACTWe find that a firm's investment is highly sensitive to the investments of other firms headquartered nearby, even those in very different industries. A firm's investment also responds to fluctuations in the cash flows and stock prices (q) of local firms outside its sector. These patterns do not appear to reflect exogenous area shocks such as local shocks to labor or real estate values, but rather suggest that local agglomeration economies are important determinants of firm investment and growth."
Short-Term Debt as Bridge Financing: Evidence from the Commercial Paper Market,MATTHIAS KAHL,17 September 2014,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12216,"ABSTRACTWe analyze why firms use nonintermediated short-term debt by studying the commercial paper (CP) market. Using a comprehensive database of CP issuers and issuance activity, we show that firms use CP to provide start-up financing for capital investment. Firms’ CP issuance is driven by a desire to minimize transaction costs associated with raising capital for new investment. We show that firms with high rollover risk are less likely to enter the CP market, borrow less CP, and borrow more from bank credit lines. Further, CP is often refinanced with long-term bond issuance to reduce rollover risk."
Taking the Long Way Home: U.S. Tax Evasion and Offshore Investments in U.S. Equity and Debt Markets,MICHELLE HANLON,04 November 2013,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12120,"ABSTRACTWe empirically investigate one form of illegal investor-level tax evasion and its effect on foreign portfolio investment. In particular, we examine a form of round-tripping tax evasion in which U.S. individuals hide funds in entities located in offshore tax havens and then invest those funds in U.S. securities markets. Employing Becker's (1968) economic theory of crime, we identify the tax evasion component by examining how foreign portfolio investment varies with changes in the incentives to evade and the risks of detection. To our knowledge, this is the first empirical evidence of investor-level tax evasion affecting cross-border equity and debt investment."
Do Acquisitions Relieve Target Firms’ Financial Constraints?,ISIL EREL,27 March 2014,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12155,"ABSTRACTManagers often claim that target firms are financially constrained prior to being acquired and that these constraints are eased following the acquisition. Using a large sample of European acquisitions, we document that the level of cash that target firms hold, the sensitivity of cash to cash flow, and the sensitivity of investment to cash flow all decline, while investment increases following the acquisition. These effects are stronger in deals that are more likely to be associated with financing improvements. Our findings suggest that acquisitions relieve financial frictions in target firms, especially when the target firm is relatively small."
The Pre-FOMC Announcement Drift,DAVID O. LUCCA,06 August 2014,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12196,"ABSTRACTWe document large average excess returns on U.S. equities in anticipation of monetary policy decisions made at scheduled meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) in the past few decades. These pre-FOMC returns have increased over time and account for sizable fractions of total annual realized stock returns. While other major international equity indices experienced similar pre-FOMC returns, we find no such effect in U.S. Treasury securities and money market futures. Other major U.S. macroeconomic news announcements also do not give rise to preannouncement excess equity returns. We discuss challenges in explaining these returns with standard asset pricing theory."
How Stable Are Corporate Capital Structures?,HARRY DeANGELO,26 March 2014,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12163,"ABSTRACTLeverage cross-sections more than a few years apart differ markedly, with similarities evaporating as the time between them lengthens. Many firms have high and low leverage at different times, but few keep debt-to-assets ratios consistently above 0.500. Capital structure stability is the exception, not the rule, occurs primarily at low leverage, and is virtually always temporary, with many firms abandoning low leverage during the post-war boom. Industry-median leverage varies widely over time. Target-leverage models that place little or no weight on maintaining a particular ratio do a good job replicating the substantial instability of the actual leverage cross-section."
Click or Call? Auction versus Search in the Over-the-Counter Market,TERRENCE HENDERSHOTT,26 March 2014,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12164,ABSTRACTOver-the-counter (OTC) markets dominate trading in many asset classes. Will electronic trading displace traditional OTC “voice” trading? Can electronic and voice systems coexist? What types of securities and trades are best suited for electronic trading? We study these questions by focusing on an innovation in electronic trading technology that enables investors to simultaneously search many bond dealers. We show that periodic one-sided electronic auctions are a viable and important source of liquidity even in inactively traded instruments. These mechanisms are a natural compromise between bilateral search in OTC markets and continuous double auctions in electronic limit order books.
Borrower Misreporting and Loan Performance,MARK J. GARMAISE,27 March 2014,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12156,"ABSTRACTBorrower misreporting is associated with seriously adverse loan outcomes. Significantly more residential mortgage borrowers reported personal assets just above round number thresholds than just below. Borrowers who reported above-threshold assets were almost 25 percentage points more likely to become delinquent (mean delinquency was 20%). For applicants with unverified assets, the increase in delinquency was greater than 40 percentage points. Misreporting was most frequent in areas with low financial literacy or social capital. Incorporating behavioral cues such as threshold effects into a risk assessment model improves its ability to uncover delinquencies, though at a cost of mischaracterizing some safe loans."
Misspecified Recovery,JAROSLAV BOROVIČKA,29 February 2016,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12404,"ABSTRACTAsset prices contain information about the probability distribution of future states and the stochastic discounting of those states as used by investors. To better understand the challenge in distinguishing investors' beliefs from risk-adjusted discounting, we use Perron–Frobenius Theory to isolate a positive martingale component of the stochastic discount factor process. This component recovers a probability measure that absorbs long-term risk adjustments. When the martingale is not degenerate, surmising that this recovered probability captures investors' beliefs distorts inference about risk-return tradeoffs. Stochastic discount factors in many structural models of asset prices have empirically relevant martingale components."
Do Creditor Rights Increase Employment Risk? Evidence from Loan Covenants,ANTONIO FALATO,04 August 2016,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12435,"ABSTRACTUsing a regression discontinuity design, we provide evidence that there are sharp and substantial employment cuts following loan covenant violations, when creditors gain rights to accelerate, restructure, or terminate a loan. The cuts are larger at firms with higher financing frictions and with weaker employee bargaining power, and during industry and macroeconomic downturns, when employees have fewer job opportunities. Union elections that create new labor bargaining units lead to higher loan spreads, consistent with creditors requiring compensation when employees gain bargaining power. Overall, binding financial contracts have a large impact on employees and are an amplification mechanism of economic downturns."
Corporate Scandals and Household Stock Market Participation,MARIASSUNTA GIANNETTI,19 February 2016,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12399,"ABSTRACTWe show that, after the revelation of corporate fraud in a state, household stock market participation in that state decreases. Households decrease holdings in fraudulent as well as nonfraudulent firms, even if they do not hold stocks in fraudulent firms. Within a state, households with more lifetime experience of corporate fraud hold less equity. Following the exogenous increase in fraud revelation due to Arthur Andersen's demise, states with more Arthur Andersen clients experience a larger decrease in stock market participation. We provide evidence that the documented effect is likely to reflect a loss of trust in the stock market."
"Credit Rationing, Income Exaggeration, and Adverse Selection in the Mortgage Market",BRENT W. AMBROSE,23 May 2016,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12426,ABSTRACTWe examine the role of borrower concerns about future credit availability in mitigating the effects of adverse selection and income misrepresentation in the mortgage market. We show that the majority of additional risk associated with “low-doc” mortgages originated prior to the Great Recession was due to adverse selection on the part of borrowers who could verify income but chose not to. We provide novel evidence that these borrowers were more likely to inflate or exaggerate their income. Our analysis suggests that recent regulatory changes that have essentially eliminated the low-doc loan product would result in credit rationing against self-employed borrowers.
A Tale of Two Runs: Depositor Responses to Bank Solvency Risk,RAJKAMAL IYER,20 May 2016,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12424,"ABSTRACTWe examine heterogeneity in depositor responses to solvency risk using depositor-level data for a bank that faced two different runs. We find that depositors with loans and bank staff are less likely to run than others during a low-solvency-risk shock, but are more likely to run during a high-solvency-risk shock. Uninsured depositors are also sensitive to bank solvency. In contrast, depositors with older accounts run less, and those with frequent past transactions run more, irrespective of the underlying risk. Our results show that the fragility of a bank depends on the composition of its deposit base."
“Lucas” in the Laboratory,ELENA ASPAROUHOVA,03 February 2016,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12392,"ABSTRACTWe study the Lucas asset pricing model in a controlled setting. Participants trade two long-lived securities in a continuous open-book system. The experimental design emulates the stationary, infinite-horizon setting of the model and incentivizes participants to smooth consumption across periods. Consistent with the model, prices align with consumption betas and comove with aggregate dividends, particularly so when risk premia are higher. Trading significantly increases consumption smoothing compared to autarky. Nevertheless, as in field markets, prices are excessively volatile. The noise corrupts traditional generalized method of moment tests. Choices display substantial heterogeneity, with no subject representative for pricing."
Compensating Financial Experts,VINCENT GLODE,13 October 2015,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12372,"ABSTRACTWe propose a labor market model in which financial firms compete for a scarce supply of workers who can be employed as either bankers or traders. While hiring bankers helps create a surplus that can be split between a firm and its trading counterparties, hiring traders helps the firm appropriate a greater share of that surplus away from its counterparties. Firms bid defensively for workers bound to become traders, who then earn more than bankers. As counterparties employ more traders, the benefit of employing bankers decreases. The model sheds light on the historical evolution of compensation in finance."
Learning about Mutual Fund Managers,DARWIN CHOI,29 February 2016,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12405,"ABSTRACTWe study capital allocations to managers with two mutual funds, and show that investors learn about managers from their performance records. Flows into a fund are predicted by the manager's performance in his other fund, especially when he outperforms and when signals from the other fund are more useful. In equilibrium, capital should be allocated such that there is no cross-fund predictability. However, we find positive predictability, particularly among underperforming funds. Our results are consistent with incomplete learning: while investors move capital in the right direction, they do not withdraw enough capital when the manager underperforms in his other fund."
Valuation Risk and Asset Pricing,RUI ALBUQUERQUE,04 August 2016,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12437,"ABSTRACTStandard representative-agent models fail to account for the weak correlation between stock returns and measurable fundamentals, such as consumption and output growth. This failing, which underlies virtually all modern asset pricing puzzles, arises because these models load all uncertainty onto the supply side of the economy. We propose a simple theory of asset pricing in which demand shocks play a central role. These shocks give rise to valuation risk that allows the model to account for key asset pricing moments, such as the equity premium, the bond term premium, and the weak correlation between stock returns and fundamentals."
Behind the Scenes: The Corporate Governance Preferences of Institutional Investors,JOSEPH A. McCAHERY,03 February 2016,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12393,"ABSTRACTWe survey institutional investors to better understand their role in the corporate governance of firms. Consistent with a number of theories, we document widespread behind-the-scenes intervention as well as governance-motivated exit. These governance mechanisms are viewed as complementary devices, with intervention typically occurring prior to a potential exit. We further find that long-term investors and investors that are less concerned about stock liquidity intervene more intensively. Finally, we find that most investors use proxy advisors and believe that the information provided by such advisors improves their own voting decisions."
Ties That Bind: How Business Connections Affect Mutual Fund Activism,DRAGANA CVIJANOVIĆ,23 May 2016,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12425,"ABSTRACTWe investigate whether business ties with portfolio firms influence mutual funds' proxy voting using a comprehensive data set spanning 2003 to 2011. In contrast to prior literature, we find that business ties significantly influence promanagement voting at the level of individual pairs of fund families and firms after controlling for Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) recommendations and holdings. The association is significant only for shareholder-sponsored proposals and stronger for those that pass or fail by relatively narrow margins. Our findings are consistent with a demand-driven model of biased voting in which company managers use existing business ties with funds to influence how they vote."
"Infrequent Rebalancing, Return Autocorrelation, and Seasonality",VINCENT BOGOUSSLAVSKY,04 August 2016,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12436,"ABSTRACTA model of infrequent rebalancing can explain specific predictability patterns in the time series and cross-section of stock returns. First, infrequent rebalancing produces return autocorrelations that are consistent with empirical evidence from intraday returns and new evidence from daily returns. Autocorrelations can switch sign and become positive at the rebalancing horizon. Second, the cross-sectional variance in expected returns is larger when more traders rebalance. This effect generates seasonality in the cross-section of stock returns, which can help explain available empirical evidence."

Who Borrows from the Lender of Last Resort?,ITAMAR DRECHSLER,23 May 2016,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12421,"ABSTRACTWe analyze lender of last resort (LOLR) lending during the European sovereign debt crisis. Using a novel data set on all central bank lending and collateral, we show that weakly capitalized banks took out more LOLR loans and used riskier collateral than strongly capitalized banks. We also find that weakly capitalized banks used LOLR loans to buy risky assets such as distressed sovereign debt. This resulted in a reallocation of risky assets from strongly to weakly capitalized banks. Our findings cannot be explained by classical LOLR theory. Rather, they point to risk taking by banks, both independently and with the encouragement of governments, and highlight the benefit of unifying LOLR lending and bank supervision."
Trade Credit and Industry Dynamics: Evidence from Trucking Firms,JEAN-NOËL BARROT,13 October 2015,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12371,"ABSTRACTLong payment terms are a strong impediment to the entry and survival of liquidity-constrained firms. To test this idea and its implications, I consider the effect of a reform restricting the trade credit supply of French trucking firms. In a difference-in-differences setting, I find that trucking firms' corporate default probability decreases by 25% following the restriction. The effect is persistent, concentrated among liquidity-constrained firms, and not offset by a decrease in profits. The restriction also triggers an increase in the entry of small trucking firms."
Financing Constraints and Workplace Safety,JONATHAN B. COHN,26 May 2016,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12430,"ABSTRACTWe present evidence that financing frictions adversely impact investment in workplace safety, with implications for worker welfare and firm value. Using several identification strategies, we find that injury rates increase with leverage and negative cash flow shocks, and decrease with positive cash flow shocks. We show that firm value decreases substantially with injury rates. Our findings suggest that investment in worker safety is an economically important margin on which firms respond to financing constraints."
"Capital Investment, Innovative Capacity, and Stock Returns",PRAVEEN KUMAR,23 May 2016,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12419,"ABSTRACTWe study the dynamic implications of capital investment in innovative capacity (IC) on future stock returns, investment, and profitability by modeling the unique effects of IC investment on uncertain option generation/exercise and postexercise revenue. The model highlights the diverse effects of IC investment on expected returns in different postinvestment regimes and yields the novel prediction that, under the neoclassical assumption of nonincreasing revenue returns, IC investment is positively related to subsequent cumulative stock returns with a lag. The model also predicts a positive effect of IC investment on future investment and profitability. We find strong empirical support for these predictions."
Speculative Betas,HARRISON HONG,27 May 2016,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12431,"ABSTRACTThe risk and return trade-off, the cornerstone of modern asset pricing theory, is often of the wrong sign. Our explanation is that high-beta assets are prone to speculative overpricing. When investors disagree about the stock market's prospects, high-beta assets are more sensitive to this aggregate disagreement, experience greater divergence of opinion about their payoffs, and are overpriced due to short-sales constraints. When aggregate disagreement is low, the Security Market Line is upward-sloping due to risk-sharing. When it is high, expected returns can actually decrease with beta. We confirm our theory using a measure of disagreement about stock market earnings."
Why Invest in Emerging Markets? The Role of Conditional Return Asymmetry,ERIC GHYSELS,23 May 2016,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12420,"ABSTRACTWe propose a quantile-based measure of conditional skewness, particularly suitable for handling recalcitrant emerging market (EM) returns. The skewness of international stock market returns varies significantly across countries over time, and persists at long horizons. In EMs, skewness is mostly positive and idiosyncratic, and significantly relates to a country's financial and trade openness and balance of payments. In an international portfolio setting, return asymmetry leads to sizeable certainty-equivalent gains and increases the weight on emerging countries to about 30%. Investing in EMs seems to be about expectations of a higher upside than downside, consistent with recent theories."
Can Brokers Have It All? On the Relation between Make-Take Fees and Limit Order Execution Quality,ROBERT BATTALIO,23 May 2016,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12422,"ABSTRACTWe identify retail brokers that seemingly route orders to maximize order flow payments, by selling market orders and sending limit orders to venues paying large liquidity rebates. Angel, Harris, and Spatt argue that such routing may not always be in customers’ best interests. For both proprietary limit order data and a broad sample of trades from TAQ, we document a negative relation between several measures of limit order execution quality and rebate/fee level. This finding suggests that order routing designed to maximize liquidity rebates does not maximize limit order execution quality and thus brokers cannot have it all."
Firing Costs and Capital Structure Decisions,MATTHEW SERFLING,29 February 2016,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12403,"ABSTRACTI exploit the adoption of state-level labor protection laws as an exogenous increase in employee firing costs to examine how the costs associated with discharging workers affect capital structure decisions. I find that firms reduce debt ratios following the adoption of these laws, with this result stronger for firms that experience larger increases in firing costs. I also document that, following the adoption of these laws, a firm's degree of operating leverage rises, earnings variability increases, and employment becomes more rigid. Overall, these results are consistent with higher firing costs crowding out financial leverage via increasing financial distress costs."
Boom and Gloom,PAUL POVEL,03 February 2016,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12391,"ABSTRACTWe study the performance of investments made at different points of an investment cycle. We use a large data set covering hotels in the United States, with rich details on their location, characteristics, and performance. We find that hotels built during hotel construction booms underperform their peers. For hotels built duringlocalhotel construction booms, this underperformance persists for several decades. We examine possible explanations for this long-lasting underperformance. The evidence is consistent with information-based herding explanations."
Picking Winners? Investment Consultants’ Recommendations of Fund Managers,TIM JENKINSON,05 May 2015,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12289,"ABSTRACTInvestment consultants advise institutional investors on their choice of fund manager. Focusing on U.S. actively managed equity funds, we analyze the factors that drive consultants’ recommendations, what impact these recommendations have on flows, and how well the recommended funds perform. We find that investment consultants’ recommendations of funds are driven largely by soft factors, rather than the funds’ past performance, and that their recommendations have a significant effect on fund flows. However, we find no evidence that these recommendations add value, suggesting that the search for winners, encouraged and guided by investment consultants, is fruitless."
Advertising Expensive Mortgages,UMIT G. GURUN,20 May 2016,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12423,"ABSTRACTUsing information on advertising and mortgages originated by subprime lenders, we study whether advertising helped consumers find cheaper mortgages. Lenders that advertise more within a region sell more expensive mortgages, measured as the excess rate of a mortgage after accounting for borrower, contract, and regional characteristics. These effects are stronger for mortgages sold to less sophisticated consumers. We exploit regional variation in mortgage advertising induced by the entry of Craigslist and other tests to demonstrate that these findings are not spurious. Analyzing advertising content reveals that initial/introductory rates are frequently advertised in a salient fashion, where reset rates are not."
The Price of Political Uncertainty: Theory and Evidence from the Option Market,BRYAN KELLY,01 March 2016,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12406,"ABSTRACTWe empirically analyze the pricing of political uncertainty, guided by a theoretical model of government policy choice. To isolate political uncertainty, we exploit its variation around national elections and global summits. We find that political uncertainty is priced in the equity option market as predicted by theory. Options whose lives span political events tend to be more expensive. Such options provide valuable protection against the price, variance, and tail risks associated with political events. This protection is more valuable in a weaker economy and amid higher political uncertainty. The effects of political uncertainty spill over across countries."
Presidential Address: Debt and Money: Financial Constraints and Sovereign Finance,PATRICK BOLTON,13 May 2016,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12418,"ABSTRACTEconomic analyses of corporate finance, money, and sovereign debt are largely considered separately. I introduce a novel corporate finance framing of sovereign finance based on the analogy between fiat liabilities for sovereigns and equity for corporations. The analysis focuses on financial constraints at the country level, making explicit the trade-offs involved in relying on domestic versus foreign-currency debt to finance investments or government expenditures. This framing provides new insights into issues ranging from the costs and benefits of inflation, optimal foreign exchange reserves, and sovereign debt restructuring."
A Model of Financialization of Commodities,SULEYMAN BASAK,13 July 2016,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12408,"ABSTRACTWe analyze how institutional investors entering commodity futures markets, referred to as the financialization of commodities, affect commodity prices. Institutional investors care about their performance relative to a commodity index. We find that all commodity futures prices, volatilities, and correlations go up with financialization, but more so for index futures than for nonindex futures. The equity-commodity correlations also increase. We demonstrate how financial markets transmit shocks not only to futures prices but also to commodity spot prices and inventories. Spot prices go up with financialization, and shocks to any index commodity spill over to all storable commodity prices."
Return Seasonalities,MATTI KELOHARJU,22 February 2016,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12398,"ABSTRACTA strategy that selects stocks based on their historical same-calendar-month returns earns an average return of 13% per year. We document similar return seasonalities in anomalies, commodities, and international stock market indices, as well as at the daily frequency. The seasonalities overwhelm unconditional differences in expected returns. The correlations between different seasonality strategies are modest, suggesting that they emanate from different systematic factors. Our results suggest that seasonalities are not a distinct class of anomalies that requires an explanation of its own, but rather that they are intertwined with other return anomalies through shared systematic factors."
The Impact of Venture Capital Monitoring,SHAI BERNSTEIN,13 October 2015,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12370,"ABSTRACTWe show that venture capitalists' (VCs) on-site involvement with their portfolio companies leads to an increase in both innovation and the likelihood of a successful exit. We rule out selection effects by exploiting an exogenous source of variation in VC involvement: the introduction of new airline routes that reduce VCs' travel times to theirexistingportfolio companies. We confirm the importance of this channel by conducting a large-scale survey of VCs, of whom almost 90% indicate that direct flights increase their interaction with their portfolio companies and management, and help them better understand companies' activities."
On Enhancing Shareholder Control: A (Dodd-) Frank Assessment of Proxy Access,JONATHAN B. COHN,01 March 2016,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12402,"ABSTRACTWe use events related to a proxy access rule passed by the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2010 as natural experiments to study the valuation effects of changes in shareholder control. We find that valuations increase (decrease) following increases (decreases) in perceived control, especially for firms that are poorly performing, have shareholders likely to exercise control, and where acquiring a stake is relatively inexpensive. These results suggest that an increase in shareholder control from its current level would generally benefit shareholders. However, we find that the benefits of increased control are muted for firms with shareholders whose interests may deviate from value maximization."
"Risk-Sharing or Risk-Taking? Counterparty Risk, Incentives, and Margins",BRUNO BIAIS,19 February 2016,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12396,"ABSTRACTDerivatives activity, motivated by risk-sharing, can breed risk-taking. Bad news about the risk of an asset underlying a derivative increases protection sellers' expected liability and undermines their risk-prevention incentives. This limits risk-sharing, creates endogenous counterparty risk, and can lead to contagion from news about the hedged risk to the balance sheet of protection sellers. Margin calls after bad news can improve protection sellers' incentives and in turn enhance risk-sharing. Central clearing can provide insurance against counterparty risk but must be designed to preserve risk-prevention incentives."
Good-Specific Habit Formation and the Cross-Section of Expected Returns,JULES H. VAN BINSBERGEN,22 February 2016,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12397,"ABSTRACTI study asset prices in a general equilibrium framework in which agents form habits over individual varieties of goods rather than over an aggregate consumption bundle. Goods are produced by monopolistically competitive firms whose elasticities of demand depend on consumers' habit formation. Firms that produce goods with a high habit level relative to consumption have low demand elasticities, set high prices for their product, have low expected returns on their stock, and have low asset pricing betas and stock return volatilities. I find supportive evidence for these predictions in the data."
Do Private Firms Invest Differently than Public Firms? Taking Cues from the Natural Gas Industry,ERIK P. GILJE,30 April 2016,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12417,"ABSTRACTWe study how listing status affects investment behavior. Theory offers competing hypotheses on how listing-related frictions affect investment decisions. We use detailed data on 74,670 individual projects in the U.S. natural gas industry to show that private firms respond less than public firms to changes in investment opportunities. Private firms adjust drilling activity for low capital-intensity investments. However, they do not increase drilling in response to new capital-intensive growth opportunities. Instead, they sell these projects to public firms. Our evidence suggests that differences in access to external capital are important in explaining the investment behavior of public and private firms."
It Pays to Set the Menu: Mutual Fund Investment Options in 401(k) Plans,VERONIKA K. POOL,15 April 2016,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12411,"ABSTRACTThis paper investigates whether mutual fund families acting as service providers in 401(k) plans display favoritism toward their own affiliated funds. Using a hand-collected data set on the menu of investment options offered to plan participants, we show that fund deletions and additions are less sensitive to prior performance for affiliated than unaffiliated funds. We find no evidence that plan participants undo this affiliation bias through their investment choices. Finally, we find that the subsequent performance of poorly performing affiliated funds indicates that this favoritism is not information driven."
Exodus from Sovereign Risk: Global Asset and Information Networks in the Pricing of Corporate Credit Risk,JONGSUB LEE,19 April 2016,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12412,"ABSTRACTUsing five-year credit default swap (CDS) spreads on 2,364 companies in 54 countries from 2004 to 2011, we find that firms exposed to stronger property rights through their foreign asset positions (institutional channel) and firms cross-listed on exchanges with stricter disclosure requirements (informational channel) reduce their CDS spreads by 40 bps for a one-standard-deviation increase in their exposure to the two channels. These channels capture effects beyond those associated with firm- and country-level fundamentals. Overall, we find that firm-level global asset and information connections are important mechanisms to delink firms from their sovereign and country risks."
The Optimal Size of Hedge Funds: Conflict between Investors and Fund Managers,CHENGDONG YIN,15 April 2016,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12413,"ABSTRACTThis study examines whether the standard compensation contract in the hedge fund industry aligns managers’ incentives with investors’ interests. I show empirically that managers’ compensation increases when fund assets grow, even when diseconomies of scale in fund performance exist. Thus, managers’ compensation is maximized at a much larger fund size than is optimal for fund performance. However, to avoid capital outflows, managers are also motivated to restrict fund growth to maintain style-average performance. Similarly, fund management firms have incentives to collect more capital for all funds under management, including their flagship funds, even at the expense of fund performance."
Report of the Editor of the Journal of Finance for the Year 2015,KENNETH J. SINGLETON,13 July 2016,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12414,
Local Currency Sovereign Risk,WENXIN DU,03 February 2016,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12389,"ABSTRACTWe introduce a new measure of emerging market sovereign credit risk: the local currency credit spread, defined as the spread of local currency bonds over the synthetic local currency risk-free rate constructed using cross-currency swaps. We find that local currency credit spreads are positive and sizable. Compared with credit spreads on foreign-currency-denominated debt, local currency credit spreads have lower means, lower cross-country correlations, and lower sensitivity to global risk factors. We discuss several major sources of credit spread differentials, including positively correlated credit and currency risk, selective default, capital controls, and various financial market frictions."
Asymmetric Information about Collateral Values,JOHANNES STROEBEL,04 May 2015,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12288,"ABSTRACTI empirically analyze credit market outcomes when competing lenders are differentially informed about the expected return from making a loan. I study the residential mortgage market, where property developers often cooperate with vertically integrated mortgage lenders to offer financing to buyers of new homes. I show that these integrated lenders have superior information about the construction quality of individual homes and exploit this information to lend against higher quality collateral, decreasing foreclosures by up to 40%. To compensate for this adverse selection on collateral quality, nonintegrated lenders charge higher interest rates when competing against a better-informed integrated lender."
Information Acquisition in Rumor-Based Bank Runs,ZHIGUO HE,11 November 2014,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12202,"ABSTRACTWe study information acquisition and dynamic withdrawal decisions when a spreading rumor exposes a solvent bank to a run. Uncertainty about the bank's liquidity and potential failure motivates depositors who hear the rumor to acquire additional noisy signals. Depositors with less informative signals may wait before gradually running on the bank, leading to an endogenous aggregate withdrawal speed and bank survival time. Private information acquisition about liquidity can subject solvent-but-illiquid banks to runs, and shorten the survival time of failing banks. Public provision of solvency information can mitigate runs by indirectly crowding-out individual depositors' effort to acquire liquidity information."
Exporting Liquidity: Branch Banking and Financial Integration,ERIK P. GILJE,03 February 2016,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12387,"ABSTRACTUsing exogenous liquidity windfalls from oil and natural gas shale discoveries, we demonstrate that bank branch networks help integrate U.S. lending markets. Banks exposed to shale booms enjoy liquidity inflows, which increase their capacity to originate and hold new loans. Exposed banks increase mortgage lending in nonboom counties, but only where they have branches and only for hard-to-securitize mortgages. Our findings suggest that contracting frictions limit the ability of arm's length finance to integrate credit markets fully. Branch networks continue to play an important role in financial integration, despite the development of securitization markets."
The Boats That Did Not Sail: Asset Price Volatility in a Natural Experiment,PETER KOUDIJS,06 August 2015,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12312,"ABSTRACTWhat explains short-term fluctuations of stock prices? This paper exploits a natural experiment from the 18 century in which information flows were regularly interrupted for exogenous reasons. English shares were traded on the Amsterdam exchange and news came in on sailboats that were often delayed because of adverse weather conditions. The paper documents that prices responded strongly to boat arrivals, but there was considerable volatility in the absence of news. The evidence suggests that this was largely the result of the revelation of (long-lived) private information and the (transitory) impact of uninformed liquidity trades on intermediaries' risk premia."
Worrying about the Stock Market: Evidence from Hospital Admissions,JOSEPH ENGELBERG,03 February 2016,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12386,"ABSTRACTUsing individual patient records for every hospital in California from 1983 to 2011, we find a strong inverse link between daily stock returns and hospital admissions, particularly for psychological conditions such as anxiety, panic disorder, and major depression. The effect is nearly instantaneous (within the same day) for psychological conditions, suggesting thatanticipationover future consumption directly influences instantaneous utility."
Short Selling and Earnings Management: A Controlled Experiment,VIVIAN W. FANG,13 October 2015,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12369,"ABSTRACTDuring 2005 to 2007, the SEC ordered a pilot program in which one-third of the Russell 3000 index were arbitrarily chosen as pilot stocks and exempted from short-sale price tests. Pilot firms’ discretionary accruals and likelihood of marginally beating earnings targets decrease during this period, and revert to pre-experiment levels when the program ends. After the program starts, pilot firms are more likely to be caught for fraud initiated before the program, and their stock returns better incorporate earnings information. These results indicate that short selling, or its prospect, curbs earnings management, helps detect fraud, and improves price efficiency."
"Collateralization, Bank Loan Rates, and Monitoring",GERALDO CERQUEIRO,17 September 2014,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12214,"ABSTRACTWe show that collateral plays an important role in the design of debt contracts, the provision of credit, and the incentives of lenders to monitor borrowers. Using a unique data set from a large bank containing timely assessments of collateral values, we find that the bank responded to a legal reform that exogenously reduced collateral values by increasing interest rates, tightening credit limits, and reducing the intensity of its monitoring of borrowers and collateral, spurring borrower delinquency on outstanding claims. We thus explain why banks are senior lenders and quantify the value of claimant priority."
From Wall Street to Main Street: The Impact of the Financial Crisis on Consumer Credit Supply,RODNEY RAMCHARAN,01 September 2014,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12209,"ABSTRACTHow did the collapseof the asset-backed securities (ABS) market during the 2007 to 2009 financial crisis affect the supply of credit to the broader economy? Using new data on the U.S. credit union industry, we find that ABS-related losses are associated with a large contraction in the supply of credit to consumers, especially among those credit unions that began the crisis with weaker capitalization. We also find that this credit supply shock restricted the availability of mortgage and automobile credit. These results show how movements in the prices of financial assets can affect the real economy."
The Total Cost of Corporate Borrowing in the Loan Market: Don't Ignore the Fees,TOBIAS BERG,01 May 2015,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12281,"ABSTRACTMore than 80% of U.S. syndicated loans contain at least one fee type and contracts typically specify a menu of spreads and fee types. We test the predictions of existing theories on the main purposes of fees and provide supporting evidence that: (1) fees are used to price options embedded in loan contracts such as the drawdown option for credit lines and the cancellation option in term loans, and (2) fees are used to screen borrowers based on the likelihood of exercising these options. We also propose a new total-cost-of-borrowing measure that includes various fees charged by lenders."
Information in the Term Structure of Yield Curve Volatility,ANNA CIESLAK,03 February 2016,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12388,"ABSTRACTUsing a novel no-arbitrage model and extensive second-moment data, we decompose conditional volatility of U.S. Treasury yields into volatilities of short-rate expectations and term premia. Short-rate expectations become more volatile than premia before recessions and during asset market distress. Correlation between shocks to premia and shocks to short-rate expectations is close to zero on average and varies with the monetary policy stance. While Treasuries are nearly unexposed to variance shocks, investors pay a premium for hedging variance risk with derivatives. We illustrate the dynamics of the yield volatility components during and after the financial crisis."
Risk-Adjusting the Returns to Venture Capital,ARTHUR KORTEWEG,03 February 2016,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12390,"ABSTRACTWe adapt stochastic discount factor (SDF) valuation methods for venture capital (VC) performance evaluation. Our approach generalizes the popular Public Market Equivalent (PME) method and allows statistical inference in the presence of cross-sectionally dependent, skewed VC payoffs. We relax SDF restrictions implicit in the PME so that the SDF can accurately reflect risk-free rates and returns of public equity markets during the sample period. This generalized PME yields substantially different abnormal performance estimates for VC funds and start-up investments, especially in times of strongly rising public equity markets and for investments with betas far from one."
Boarding a Sinking Ship? An Investigation of Job Applications to Distressed Firms,JENNIFER BROWN,13 October 2015,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12367,"ABSTRACTWe use novel data from a leading online job search platform to examine the impact of corporate distress on firms’ ability to attract job applicants. Survey responses suggest that job seekers accurately perceive firms’ financial condition, as measured by companies’ credit default swap prices and accounting data. Analyzing responses to job postings by major financial firms during the Great Recession, we find that an increase in an employer's distress results in fewer and lower quality applicants. These effects are particularly evident when the social safety net provides workers with weak protection against unemployment and for positions requiring a college education."
Learning about Consumption Dynamics,MICHAEL JOHANNES,27 January 2015,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12246,"ABSTRACTThis paper characterizes U.S. consumption dynamics from the perspective of a Bayesian agent who does not know the underlying model structure but learns over time from macroeconomic data. Realistic, high-dimensional macroeconomic learning problems, which entail parameter, model, and state learning, generate substantially different subjective beliefs about consumption dynamics compared to the standard, full-information rational expectations benchmark. Beliefs about long-run dynamics are volatile, with counter-cyclical conditional volatility, and drift over time. Embedding these beliefs in a standard asset pricing model significantly improves the model's ability to match the stylized facts, as well as the sample path of the market price-dividend ratio."
Information Flows in Foreign Exchange Markets: Dissecting Customer Currency Trades,LUKAS MENKHOFF,18 March 2016,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12378,"ABSTRACTWe study the information in order flows in the world's largest over-the-counter market, the foreign exchange (FX) market. The analysis draws on a data set covering a broad cross-section of currencies and different customer segments of FX end-users. The results suggest that order flows are highly informative about future exchange rates and provide significant economic value. We also find that different customer groups can share risk with each other effectively through the intermediation of a large dealer, and differ markedly in their predictive ability, trading styles, and risk exposure."
"Conglomerate Investment, Skewness, and the CEO Long-Shot Bias",CHRISTOPH SCHNEIDER,04 January 2016,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12379,"ABSTRACTDo behavioral biases of executives matter for corporate investment decisions? Using segment-level capital allocation in multisegment firms (“conglomerates”) as a laboratory, we show that capital expenditure is increasing in the expected skewness of segment returns. Conglomerates invest more in high-skewness segments than matched stand-alone firms, and trade at a discount, which indicates overinvestment that is detrimental to shareholder wealth. Using geographical variation in gambling norms, we find that the skewness-investment relation is particularly pronounced when CEOs are likely to find long shots attractive. Our findings suggest that CEOs allocate capital with a long-shot bias."
Order Flow and Expected Option Returns,DMITRIY MURAVYEV,21 December 2015,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12380,"ABSTRACTI show that the inventory risk faced by market-makers has a first-order effect on option prices. I introduce a simple approach that decomposes the price impact of trades into inventory risk and asymmetric information components. While both components are large for option trades, the inventory risk component is larger. Using the full panel of daily option returns, I find that option order imbalances attributable to inventory risk have five times larger impact on option prices than previously thought. Finally, I find that past order imbalances have greater predictive power than any other commonly used predictor of option returns."
Cream-Skimming in Financial Markets,PATRICK BOLTON,05 January 2016,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12385,"ABSTRACTWe propose a model in which investors may choose to acquire costly information that identifies good assets and purchase these assets in opaque (OTC) markets. Uninformed investors access an asset pool that has been cream-skimmed by informed investors. When the quality composition of assets for sale is fixed, there is too much information acquisition and the financial industry extracts excessive rents. In the presence of moral hazard in origination, the social value of information varies inversely with information acquisition. Low quality origination is associated with large rents in the financial sector. Equilibrium acquisition of information is generically inefficient."
Does It Pay to Bet Against Beta? On the Conditional Performance of the Beta Anomaly,SCOTT CEDERBURG,22 December 2015,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12383,"ABSTRACTPrior studies find that a strategy that buys high-beta stocks and sells low-beta stocks has a significantly negative unconditional capital asset pricing model (CAPM) alpha, such that it appears to pay to “bet against beta.” We show, however, that the conditional beta for the high-minus-low beta portfolio covaries negatively with the equity premium and positively with market volatility. As a result, the unconditional alpha is a downward-biased estimate of the true alpha. We model the conditional market risk for beta-sorted portfolios using instrumental variables methods and find that the conditional CAPM resolves the beta anomaly."
The Labor Market for Directors and Externalities in Corporate Governance,DORON LEVIT,01 May 2015,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12287,"ABSTRACTThis paper studies how directors' reputational concerns affect board structure, corporate governance, and firm value. In our setting, directors affect their firms' governance, and governance in turn affects firms' demand for new directors. Whether the labor market rewards a shareholder-friendly or management-friendly reputation is determined in equilibrium and depends on aggregate governance. We show that directors' desire to be invited to other boards creates strategic complementarity of corporate governance across firms. Directors' reputational concerns amplify the governance system: strong systems become stronger and weak systems become weaker. We derive implications for multiple directorships, board size, transparency, and board independence."
An Information-Based Theory of Time-Varying Liquidity,BRENDAN DALEY,18 March 2015,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12272,"ABSTRACTWe propose an information-based theory to explain time variation in liquidity and link it to a variety of patterns in asset markets. In “normal times,” the market is fully liquid and gains from trade are realized immediately. However, the equilibrium also involves periods during which liquidity “dries up,” which leads to endogenous liquidation costs. Traders correctly anticipate such costs, which reduces their willingness to pay. This foresight leads to a novel feedback effect between prices and market liquidity, which are jointly determined in equilibrium. The model also predicts that contagious sell-offs can occur after sufficiently bad news."
Indirect Incentives of Hedge Fund Managers,JONGHA LIM,21 December 2015,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12384,"ABSTRACTIndirect incentives exist in the money management industry when good current performance increases future inflows of capital, leading to higher future fees. For the average hedge fund, indirect incentives are at least 1.4 times as large as direct incentives from incentive fees and managers’ personal stakes in the fund. Combining direct and indirect incentives, manager wealth increases by at least $0.39 for a $1 increase in investor wealth. Younger and more scalable hedge funds have stronger flow-performance relations, leading to stronger indirect incentives. These results have a number of implications for our understanding of incentives in the asset management industry."
Procyclical Capital Regulation and Lending,MARKUS BEHN,13 October 2015,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12368,"ABSTRACTWe use a quasi-experimental research design to examine the effect of model-based capital regulation on the procyclicality of bank lending and firms' access to funds. In response to an exogenous shock to credit risk in the German economy, capital charges for loans under model-based regulation increased by 0.5 percentage points. As a consequence, banks reduced the amount of these loans by 2.1 to 3.9 percentage points more than for loans under the traditional approach with fixed capital charges. We find an even stronger effect when we examine aggregate firm borrowing, suggesting that microprudential capital regulation can have sizeable real effects."
Health and Mortality Delta: Assessing the Welfare Cost of Household Insurance Choice,RALPH S.J. KOIJEN,18 March 2015,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12273,"ABSTRACTWe develop a pair of risk measures, health and mortality delta, for the universe of life and health insurance products. A life-cycle model of insurance choice simplifies to replicating the optimal health and mortality delta through a portfolio of insurance products. We estimate the model to explain the observed variation in health and mortality delta implied by the ownership of life insurance, annuities including private pensions, and long-term care insurance in the Health and Retirement Study. For the median household aged 51 to 57, the lifetime welfare cost of market incompleteness and suboptimal choice is 3.2% of total wealth."
Does Academic Research Destroy Stock Return Predictability?,R. DAVID MCLEAN,13 October 2015,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12365,"ABSTRACTWe study the out-of-sample and post-publication return predictability of 97 variables shown to predict cross-sectional stock returns. Portfolio returns are 26% lower out-of-sample and 58% lower post-publication. The out-of-sample decline is an upper bound estimate of data mining effects. We estimate a 32% (58%–26%) lower return from publication-informed trading. Post-publication declines are greater for predictors with higher in-sample returns, and returns are higher for portfolios concentrated in stocks with high idiosyncratic risk and low liquidity. Predictor portfolios exhibit post-publication increases in correlations with other published-predictor portfolios. Our findings suggest that investors learn about mispricing from academic publications."
Stock Market Volatility and Learning,KLAUS ADAM,13 October 2015,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12364,"ABSTRACTWe show that consumption-based asset pricing models with time-separable preferences generate realistic amounts of stock price volatility if one allows for small deviations from rational expectations. Rational investors with subjective beliefs about price behavior optimally learn from past price observations. This imparts momentum and mean reversion into stock prices. The model quantitatively accounts for the volatility of returns, the volatility and persistence of the price-dividend ratio, and the predictability of long-horizon returns. It passes a formal statistical test for the overall fit of a set of moments provided one excludes the equity premium."
Earnings Announcements and Systematic Risk,PAVEL SAVOR,14 October 2015,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12361,"ABSTRACTFirms scheduled to report earnings earn an annualized abnormal return of 9.9%. We propose a risk-based explanation for this phenomenon, whereby investors use announcements to revise their expectations for nonannouncing firms, but can only do so imperfectly. Consequently, the covariance between firm-specific and market cash flow news spikes around announcements, making announcers especially risky. Consistent with our hypothesis, announcer returns forecast aggregate earnings. The announcement premium is persistent across stocks, and early (late) announcers earn higher (lower) returns. Nonannouncers' response to announcements is consistent with our model, both over time and across firms. Finally, exposure to announcement risk is priced."
"Corporate Acquisitions, Diversification, and the Firm's Life Cycle",ASLI M. ARIKAN,13 October 2015,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12362,"ABSTRACTAgency theories predict that older firms make value-destroying acquisitions to benefit managers. Neoclassical theories predict instead that such firms make wealth-increasing acquisitions to exploit underutilized assets. Using IPO cohorts, we establish that, while younger firms make more related and diversifying acquisitions than mature firms, the acquisition rate follows a U-shape over firms’ life cycle. Consistent with neoclassical theories, we show that acquiring firms have better performance and growth opportunities and create wealth through acquisitions of nonpublic firms throughout their life. Consistent with agency theories, older firms experience negative stock price reactions for acquisitions of public firms."
Disappearing Call Delay and Dividend-Protected Convertible Bonds,BRUCE D. GRUNDY,13 October 2015,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12363,"ABSTRACTFirms do not historically call their convertible bonds as soon as conversion can be forced. A number of explanations for the delay rely on the size of the dividends that bondholders forgo so long as they do not convert. We investigate an important change in convertible security design, namely, dividend protection of convertible bond issues. Dividend protection means that the conversion value of the convertible bond is unaffected by dividend payments and thus dividend-related rationales for call delay become moot. We document that call delay is near zero for dividend-protected convertible bonds."
The Calm before the Storm,FERHAT AKBAS,24 October 2015,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12377,"ABSTRACTI provide evidence that stocks experiencing unusually low trading volume over the week prior to earnings announcements have more unfavorable earnings surprises. This effect is more pronounced among stocks with higher short-selling constraints. These findings support the view that unusually low trading volume signals negative information, since, under short-selling constraints, informed agents with bad news stay by the sidelines. Changes in visibility or risk-based explanations are insufficient to explain the results. This evidence provides insights into why unusually low trading volume predicts price declines."
"Looking for Someone to Blame: Delegation, Cognitive Dissonance, and the Disposition Effect",TOM Y. CHANG,06 August 2015,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12311,"ABSTRACTWe analyze brokerage data and an experiment to test a cognitive dissonance based theory of trading: investors avoid realizing losses because they dislike admitting that past purchases were mistakes, but delegation reverses this effect by allowing the investor to blame the manager instead. Using individual trading data, we show that the disposition effect—the propensity to realize past gains more than past losses—applies only to nondelegated assets like individual stocks; delegated assets, like mutual funds, exhibit a robust reverse-disposition effect. In an experiment, we show that increasing investors' cognitive dissonance results in both a larger disposition effect in stocks and a larger reverse-disposition effect in funds. Additionally, increasing the salience of delegation increases the reverse-disposition effect in funds. Cognitive dissonance provides a unified explanation for apparently contradictory investor behavior across asset classes and has implications for personal investment decisions, mutual fund management, and intermediation."
Can Markets Discipline Government Agencies? Evidence from the Weather Derivatives Market,AMIYATOSH PURNANANDAM,13 October 2015,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12366,"ABSTRACTWe analyze the role of financial markets in shaping the incentives of government agencies using a unique empirical setting: the weather derivatives market. We show that the introduction of weather derivative contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) improves the accuracy of temperature measurement by 13% to 20% at the underlying weather stations. We argue that temperature-based financial markets generate additional scrutiny of the temperature data measured by the National Weather Service, which motivates the agency to minimize measurement errors. Our results have broader implications: the visibility and scrutiny generated by financial markets can potentially improve the efficiency of government agencies."
News Trading and Speed,THIERRY FOUCAULT,21 May 2015,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12302,"ABSTRACTWe compare the optimal trading strategy of an informed speculator when he can trade ahead of incoming news (is “fast”), versus when he cannot (is “slow”). We find that speed matters: the fast speculator's trades account for a larger fraction of trading volume, and are more correlated with short-run price changes. Nevertheless, he realizes a large fraction of his profits from trading on long-term price changes. The fast speculator's behavior matches evidence about high-frequency traders. We predict that stocks with more informative news are more liquid even though they attract more activity from informed high-frequency traders."
Mutual Fund Flows and Cross-Fund Learning within Families,DAVID P. BROWN,05 March 2015,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12263,"ABSTRACTWe develop a model of performance evaluation and fund flows for mutual funds in a family. Family performance has two effects on a member fund's estimated skill and inflows: a positive common-skill effect, and a negative correlated-noise effect. The overall spillover can be either positive or negative, depending on the weight of common skill and correlation of noise in returns. Its absolute value increases with family size, and declines over time. The sensitivity of flows to a fund's own performance is affected accordingly. Empirical estimates of fund flow sensitivities show patterns consistent with rational cross-fund learning within families."
Idiosyncratic Cash Flows and Systematic Risk,ILONA BABENKO,01 May 2015,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12280,"ABSTRACTWe show that unpriced cash flow shocks contain information about future priced risk. A positive idiosyncratic shock decreases the sensitivity of firm value to priced risk factors and simultaneously increases firm size and idiosyncratic risk. A simple model can therefore explain book-to-market and size anomalies, as well as the negative relation between idiosyncratic volatility and stock returns. Empirically, we find that anomalies are more pronounced for firms with high idiosyncratic cash flow volatility. More generally, our results imply that any economic variable correlated with the history of idiosyncratic shocks can help to explain expected stock returns."
The Determinants of Long-Term Corporate Debt Issuances,DOMINIQUE C. BADOER,05 March 2015,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12264,"ABSTRACTA significant proportion of the debt issued by investment-grade firms has maturities greater than 20 years. In this paper we provide evidence that gap-filling behavior is an important determinant of these very long-term issues. Using data on individual corporate debt issues between 1987 and 2009, we find that gap-filling behavior is more prominent in the very long end of the maturity spectrum where the required risk capital makes arbitrage costly. In addition, changes in the supply of long-term government bonds affect not just the choice of maturity but also the overall level of corporate borrowing."
The Macroeconomics of Shadow Banking,ALAN MOREIRA,22 June 2017,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12540,"ABSTRACTWe build a macrofinance model of shadow banking—the transformation of risky assets into securities that are money-like in quiet times but become illiquid when uncertainty spikes. Shadow banking economizes on scarce collateral, expanding liquidity provision, boosting asset prices and growth, but also building up fragility. A rise in uncertainty raises shadow banking spreads, forcing financial institutions to switch to collateral-intensive funding. Shadow banking collapses, liquidity provision shrinks, liquidity premia and discount rates rise, asset prices and investment fall. The model generates slow recoveries, collateral runs, and flight-to-quality effects, and it sheds light on Large-Scale Asset Purchases, Operation Twist, and other interventions."
Consumer Ruthlessness and Mortgage Default during the 2007 to 2009 Housing Bust,NEIL BHUTTA,15 May 2017,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12523,"ABSTRACTFrom 2007 to 2009 U.S. house prices plunged and mortgage defaults surged. While ostensibly consistent with widespread “ruthless default,” analysis of detailed mortgage and house price data indicates that borrowers do not walk away until they are deeply underwater—far deeper than traditional models predict. The evidence suggests that lender recourse is not the major driver of this result. We argue that emotional and behavioral factors play an important role in decisions to continue paying. Borrower reluctance to walk away implies that the moral hazard cost of default as a form of social insurance may be lower than suspected."
Matching Capital and Labor,JONATHAN B. BERK,22 June 2017,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12542,"ABSTRACTWe establish an important role for the firm by studying capital reallocation decisions of mutual fund firms. The firm's decision to reallocate capital among its mutual fund managers adds at least $474,000 a month, which amounts to over 30% of the total value added of the industry. We provide evidence that this additional value added results from the firm's private information about the skill of its managers. The firm captures this value because investors reward the firm following a capital reallocation decision by allocating additional capital to the firm's funds."
Why Do Investors Hold Socially Responsible Mutual Funds?,ARNO RIEDL,01 August 2017,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12547,"ABSTRACTTo understand why investors hold socially responsible mutual funds, we link administrative data to survey responses and behavior in incentivized experiments. We find that both social preferences and social signaling explain socially responsible investment (SRI) decisions. Financial motives play less of a role. Socially responsible investors in our sample expect to earn lower returns on SRI funds than on conventional funds and pay higher management fees. This suggests that investors are willing to forgo financial performance in order to invest in accordance with their social preferences."
How Do Quasi-Random Option Grants Affect CEO Risk-Taking?,KELLY SHUE,01 August 2017,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12545,"ABSTRACTWe examine how an increase in stock option grants affects CEO risk-taking. The overall net effect of option grants is theoretically ambiguous for risk-averse CEOs. To overcome the endogeneity of option grants, we exploit institutional features of multiyear compensation plans, which generate two distinct types of variation in the timing of when large increases in new at-the-money options are granted. We find that, given average grant levels during our sample period, a 10% increase in new options granted leads to a 2.8% to 4.2% increase in equity volatility. This increase in risk is driven largely by increased leverage."
Are CDS Auctions Biased and Inefficient?,SONGZI DU,21 June 2017,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12541,"ABSTRACTWe study the design of credit default swaps (CDS) auctions, which determine the payments by CDS sellers to CDS buyers following defaults of bonds. Using a simple model, we find that the current design of CDS auctions leads to biased prices and inefficient allocations. This is because various restrictions imposed in CDS auctions prevent certain investors from participating in the price discovery and allocation process. The imposition of a price cap or floor also gives dealers large influence on the final auction price. We propose an alternative double auction design that delivers more efficient price discovery and allocations."
Commodity Trade and the Carry Trade: A Tale of Two Countries,ROBERT READY,21 August 2017,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12546,"ABSTRACTPersistent interest rate differentials account for much of the currency carry trade profitability. “Commodity currencies” offer high interest rates on average, while countries that export finished goods tend to have low interest rates. We develop a general equilibrium model of international trade and currency pricing where countries have an advantage in producing either basic inputs or final goods. In the model, domestic production insulates commodity-producing countries from global productivity shocks, forcing final-good producers to absorb them. Commodity-currency exchange rates and risk premia increase with productivity differentials and trade frictions. These predictions are strongly supported in the data."
"Financial Transaction Taxes, Market Composition, and Liquidity",JEAN-EDOUARD COLLIARD,06 April 2017,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12510,"ABSTRACTWe use the introduction of a financial transaction tax (FTT) in France in 2012 to test competing theories on its impact. We find no support for the idea that an FTT improves market quality by affecting the composition of trading volume. Instead, our results are in line with the hypothesis that a lower trading volume reduces liquidity and in turn market quality. Consistent with theories of asset pricing under transaction costs, we document a shift in security holdings from short-term to long-term investors. Finally, we find that moderate aggregate effects on market quality can mask large adjustments made by individual agents."
Why Does Return Predictability Concentrate in Bad Times?,JULIEN CUJEAN,01 August 2017,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12544,"ABSTRACTWe build an equilibrium model to explain why stock return predictability concentrates in bad times. The key feature is that investors use different forecasting models, and hence assess uncertainty differently. As economic conditions deteriorate, uncertainty rises and investors' opinions polarize. Disagreement thus spikes in bad times, causing returns to react to past news. This phenomenon creates a positive relation between disagreement and future returns. It also generates time-series momentum, which strengthens in bad times, increases with disagreement, and crashes after sharp market rebounds. We provide empirical support for these new predictions."
Nonfundamental Speculation Revisited,LIYAN YANG,01 August 2017,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12548,"ABSTRACTWe show that a linear pure strategy equilibrium may not exist in the model of Madrigal (1996), contrary to the claim of the original paper. This is because Madrigal's characterization of a pure strategy equilibrium omits a second-order condition. If the nonfundamental speculator's information about noise trading is sufficiently precise, a linear pure strategy equilibrium fails to exist. In parameter regions where a pure strategy equilibrium does exist, we identify a few calculation errors in Madrigal (1996) that result in misleading implications."

The Front Men of Wall Street: The Role of CDO Collateral Managers in the CDO Boom and Bust,SERGEY CHERNENKO,15 May 2017,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12520,"ABSTRACTI study the incentives of the collateral managers who selected securities for ABS CDOs—securitizations that figured prominently in the financial crisis. Specialized managers without other businesses that could suffer negative reputational consequences invested in low-quality securities underwritten by the CDO's arranger. These securities performed significantly worse than observationally similar securities. Managers investing in these securities were rewarded with additional collateral management assignments. Diversified managers who did assemble CDOs suffered negative reputational consequences during the crisis: institutional investors withdrew from their mutual funds. Overall, the results are consistent with a quid pro quo between collateral managers and CDO underwriters."
The Downside of Asset Screening for Market Liquidity,VICTORIA VANASCO,15 May 2017,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12519,"ABSTRACTThis paper explores the tension between asset quality and market liquidity. I model an originator who screens assets whose cash flows are later sold in secondary markets. Screening improves asset quality but gives rise to asymmetric information, hindering trade of the asset cash flows. In the optimal mechanism (second-best), costly retention of cash flows is essential to implement asset screening. Market allocations can feature too much or too little screening relative to second-best, where too much screening generates inefficiently illiquid markets. Furthermore, the economy is prone to multiple equilibria. The optimal mechanism is decentralized with two tools: retention rules and transfers."
Benchmarks in Search Markets,DARRELL DUFFIE,01 June 2017,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12525,"ABSTRACTWe characterize the role of benchmarks in price transparency of over-the-counter markets. A benchmark can raise social surplus by increasing the volume of beneficial trade, facilitating more efficient matching between dealers and customers, and reducing search costs. Although the market transparency promoted by benchmarks reduces dealers' profit margins, dealers may nonetheless introduce a benchmark to encourage greater market participation by investors. Low-cost dealers may also introduce a benchmark to increase their market share relative to high-cost dealers. We construct a revelation mechanism that maximizes welfare subject to search frictions, and show conditions under which it coincides with announcing the benchmark."
What Drives the Cross-Section of Credit Spreads?: A Variance Decomposition Approach,YOSHIO NOZAWA,23 May 2017,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12524,"ABSTRACTI decompose the variation of credit spreads for corporate bonds into changing expected returns and changing expectation of credit losses. Using a log-linearized pricing identity and a vector autoregression applied to microlevel data from 1973 to 2011, I find that expected returns contribute to the cross-sectional variance of credit spreads nearly as much as expected credit loss does. However, most of the time-series variation in credit spreads for the market portfolio corresponds to risk premiums."
Income Insurance and the Equilibrium Term Structure of Equity,ROBERTO MARFÈ,18 March 2017,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12508,"ABSTRACTOutput, wages, and dividends feature term structures of variance ratios that are respectively flat, increasing, and decreasing. Income insurance from shareholders to workers explains these term structures. Risk-sharing smooths wages but only concerns transitory risk and hence enhances short-run dividend risk. As a result, actual labor-share variation largely forecasts the risk, premium, and slope of dividend strips. A simple general equilibrium model in which labor rigidity affects dividend dynamics and the price of short-run risk reconciles standard asset pricing facts with the term structures of the equity premium, volatility, and macroeconomic variables, which are at odds in leading models."
A Labor Capital Asset Pricing Model,LARS-ALEXANDER KUEHN,18 March 2017,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12504,"ABSTRACTWe show that labor search frictions are an important determinant of the cross-section of equity returns. Empirically, we find that firms with low loadings on labor market tightness outperform firms with high loadings by 6% annually. We propose a partial equilibrium labor market model in which heterogeneous firms make dynamic employment decisions under labor search frictions. In the model, loadings on labor market tightness proxy for priced time-variation in the efficiency of the aggregate matching technology. Firms with low loadings are more exposed to adverse matching efficiency shocks and require higher expected stock returns."
Firm Investment and Stakeholder Choices: A Top-Down Theory of Capital Budgeting,ANDRES ALMAZAN,01 June 2017,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12526,"ABSTRACTThis paper develops a top-down model of capital budgeting in which privately informed executives make investment choices that convey information to the firm's stakeholders (e.g., employees). Favorable information in this setting encourages stakeholders to take actions that positively contribute to the firm's success (e.g., employees work harder). Within this framework we examine how firms may distort their investment choices to influence the information conveyed to stakeholders and show that investment rigidities and overinvestment can arise as optimal investment distortions. We also examine investment distortions in multi-divisional firms and compare such distortions to those in single-division firms."
On the Origins of Risk-Taking in Financial Markets,SANDRA E. BLACK,15 May 2017,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12521,"ABSTRACTFinancial investment behavior is highly correlated between parents and their children. Using Swedish data, we find that the decision of adoptees to hold equities is associated with the behavior of both biological and adoptive parents, implying a role for both genetic and environmental influences. However, we find that nurture has a stronger influence on the share of financial assets invested in equities and on portfolio volatility, suggesting that financial risk-taking is substantially environmentally determined. The parental investment variables substantially increase the explanatory power of cross-sectional regressions and so may play an important role in understanding cross-sectional heterogeneity in investment behavior."
Do Cash Flows of Growth Stocks Really Grow Faster?,HUAFENG (JASON) CHEN,15 May 2017,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12518,"ABSTRACTContrary to conventional wisdom, growth stocks (i.e., low book-to-market stocks) do not havesubstantiallyhigher future cash-flow growth rates than value stocks, in both rebalanced and buy-and-hold portfolios. Efficiency growth, survivorship and look-back biases, and the rebalancing effect help explain the results. These findings suggest that duration alone is unlikely to explain the value premium."
"Consumer Default, Credit Reporting, and Borrowing Constraints",MARK J. GARMAISE,15 May 2017,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12522,"ABSTRACTWhy do negative credit events lead to long-term borrowing constraints? Exploiting banking regulations in Peru and utilizing currency movements, we show that consumers who face a credit rating downgrade due to bad luck experience a three-year reduction in financing. Consumers respond to the shock by paying down their most troubled loans, but nonetheless end up more likely to exit the credit market. For a set of borrowers who experience severe delinquency, we find that the associated credit reporting downgrade itself accounts for 25% to 65% of their observed decline in borrowing at various horizons over the following several years."
Presidential Address: The Scientific Outlook in Financial Economics,CAMPBELL R. HARVEY,08 July 2017,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12530,"AbstractABSTRACTGiven the competition for top journal space, there is an incentive to produce “significant” results. With the combination of unreported tests, lack of adjustment for multiple tests, and direct and indirectp-hacking, many of the results being published will fail to hold up in the future. In addition, there are basic issues with the interpretation of statistical significance. Increasing thresholds may be necessary, but still may not be sufficient: if the effect being studied is rare, event> 3 will produce a large number of false positives. Here I explore the meaning and limitations of ap-value. I offer a simple alternative (the minimum Bayes factor). I present guidelines for a robust, transparent research culture in financial economics. Finally, I offer some thoughts on the importance of risk-taking (from the perspective of authors and editors) to advance our field.SUMMARYEmpirical research in financial economics relies too much onp-values, which are poorly understood in the first place.Journals want to publish papers with positive results and this incentivizes researchers to engage in data mining and “p-hacking.”The outcome will likely be an embarrassing number of false positives—effects that will not be repeated in the future.The minimum Bayes factor (which is a function of thep-value) combined with prior odds provides a simple solution that can be reported alongside the usualp-value.The Bayesianizedp-value answers the question: What is the probability that the null is true?The same technique can be used to answer: What threshold oft-statistic do I need so that there is only a 5% chance that the null is true?The threshold depends on the economic plausibility of the hypothesis."
Retail Financial Advice: Does One Size Fit All?,STEPHEN FOERSTER,12 April 2017,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12514,"ABSTRACTUsing unique data on Canadian households, we show that financial advisors exert substantial influence over their clients' asset allocation, but provide limited customization. Advisor fixed effects explain considerably more variation in portfolio risk and home bias than a broad set of investor attributes that includes risk tolerance, age, investment horizon, and financial sophistication. Advisor effects remain important even when controlling flexibly for unobserved heterogeneity through investor fixed effects. An advisor's own asset allocation strongly predicts the allocations chosen on clients' behalf. This one-size-fits-all advice does not come cheap: advised portfolios cost 2.5% per year, or 1.5% more than life cycle funds."
Do Funds Make More When They Trade More?,ĽUBOŠ PÁSTOR,19 March 2017,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12509,"ABSTRACTWe model fund turnover in the presence of time-varying profit opportunities. Our model predicts a positive relation between an active fund's turnover and its subsequent benchmark-adjusted return. We find such a relation for equity mutual funds. This time-series relation between turnover and performance is stronger than the cross-sectional relation, as the model predicts. Also as predicted, the turnover-performance relation is stronger for funds trading less-liquid stocks and funds likely to possess greater skill. Turnover is correlated across funds. The common component of turnover is positively correlated with proxies for stock mispricing. Turnover of similar funds helps predict a fund's performance."
Term Structure of Consumption Risk Premia in the Cross Section of Currency Returns,IRINA ZVIADADZE,03 February 2017,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12501,"ABSTRACTI relate the downward-sloping term structure of currency carry returns to compensation for currency exposures to macroeconomic risk embedded in the joint dynamics of U.S. consumption, inflation, nominal interest rate, and their stochastic variance. The interest rate and inflation shocks play a prominent role. Higher yield currencies exhibit higher multiperiod exposures to these shocks. The prices of these risk exposures are positive and sizeable across all investment horizons. The interest rate shock is qualitatively similar to the long-run risk of Bansal and Yaron."
Trader Leverage and Liquidity,BIGE KAHRAMAN,18 March 2017,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12507,"ABSTRACTDoes trader leverage drive equity market liquidity? We use the unique features of the margin trading system in India to identify a causal relationship between traders’ ability to borrow and a stock's market liquidity. To quantify the impact of trader leverage, we employ a regression discontinuity design that exploits threshold rules that determine a stock's margin trading eligibility. We find that liquidity is higher when stocks become eligible for margin trading and that this liquidity enhancement is driven by margin traders’ contrarian strategies. Consistent with downward liquidity spirals due to deleveraging, we also find that this effect reverses during crises."
Volatility-Managed Portfolios,ALAN MOREIRA,06 April 2017,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12513,"ABSTRACTManaged portfolios that take less risk when volatility is high produce large alphas, increase Sharpe ratios, and produce large utility gains for mean-variance investors. We document this for the market, value, momentum, profitability, return on equity, investment, and betting-against-beta factors, as well as the currency carry trade. Volatility timing increases Sharpe ratios because changes in volatility are not offset by proportional changes in expected returns. Our strategy is contrary to conventional wisdom because it takes relatively less risk in recessions. This rules out typical risk-based explanations and is a challenge to structural models of time-varying expected returns."
Advance Refundings of Municipal Bonds,ANDREW ANG,18 March 2017,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12506,"ABSTRACTThe advance refunding of debt is a widespread practice in municipal finance. In an advance refunding, municipalities retire callable bonds early and refund them with bonds with lower coupon rates. We find that 85% of all advance refundings occur at a net present value loss, and that the aggregate losses over the past 20 years exceed $15 billion. We explore why municipalities advance refund their debt at loss. Financially constrained municipalities may face pressure to advance refund since it allows them to reduce short-term cash outflows. We find strong evidence that financial constraints are a major driver of advance refunding activity."
Municipal Bond Liquidity and Default Risk,MICHAEL SCHWERT,06 April 2017,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12511,"ABSTRACTThis paper examines the pricing of municipal bonds. I use three distinct, complementary approaches to decompose municipal bond spreads into default and liquidity components, and find that default risk accounts for 74% to 84% of the average spread after adjusting for tax-exempt status. The first approach estimates the liquidity component using transaction data, the second measures the default component with credit default swap data, and the third is a quasi-natural experiment that estimates changes in default risk around pre-refunding events. The price of default risk is high given the rare incidence of municipal default and implies a high risk premium."
Selling Failed Banks,JOÃO GRANJA,06 April 2017,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12512,"ABSTRACTThe average FDIC loss from selling a failed bank is 28% of assets. We document that failed banks are predominantly sold to bidders within the same county, with similar assets business lines, when these bidders are well capitalized. Otherwise, they are acquired by less similar banks located further away. We interpret these facts within a model of auctions with budget constraints, in which poor capitalization of some potential acquirers drives a wedge between their willingness and ability to pay for failed banks. We document that this wedge drives misallocation, and partially explains the FDIC losses from failed bank sales."
"Social Capital, Trust, and Firm Performance: The Value of Corporate Social Responsibility during the Financial Crisis",KARL V. LINS,19 March 2017,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12505,"ABSTRACTDuring the 2008–2009 financial crisis, firms with high social capital, as measured by corporate social responsibility (CSR) intensity, had stock returns that were four to seven percentage points higher than firms with low social capital. High-CSR firms also experienced higher profitability, growth, and sales per employee relative to low-CSR firms, and they raised more debt. This evidence suggests that the trust between a firm and both its stakeholders and investors, built through investments in social capital, pays off when the overall level of trust in corporations and markets suffers a negative shock."
Capital Account Liberalization and Aggregate Productivity: The Role of Firm Capital Allocation,MAURICIO LARRAIN,25 January 2017,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12497,"ABSTRACTWe study the effects of capital account liberalization on firm capital allocation and aggregate productivity in 10 Eastern European countries. Using a large firm-level data set, we show that capital account liberalization decreases the dispersion in the return to capital across firms, particularly in sectors more dependent on external finance. We provide evidence that capital account liberalization improves capital allocation by allowing financially constrained firms to demand more capital and produce at a more efficient level. Finally, using a model of misallocation we document that capital account liberalization increases aggregate productivity through more efficient capital allocation by 10% to 16%."

The Flash Crash: High-Frequency Trading in an Electronic Market,ANDREI KIRILENKO,25 January 2017,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12498,"ABSTRACTWe study intraday market intermediation in an electronic market before and during a period of large and temporary selling pressure. On May 6, 2010, U.S. financial markets experienced a systemic intraday event—the Flash Crash—where a large automated selling program was rapidly executed in the E-mini S&P 500 stock index futures market. Using audit trail transaction-level data for the E-mini on May 6 and the previous three days, we find that the trading pattern of the most active nondesignated intraday intermediaries (classified as High-Frequency Traders) did not change when prices fell during the Flash Crash."
"Firm Age, Investment Opportunities, and Job Creation",MANUEL ADELINO,18 February 2017,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12495,"ABSTRACTNew firms are an important source of job creation, but the underlying economic mechanisms for why this is so are not well understood. Using an identification strategy that links shocks to local income to job creation in the nontradable sector, we ask whether job creation arises more through new firm creation or through the expansion of existing firms. We find that new firms account for the bulk of net employment creation in response to local investment opportunities. We also find significant gross job creation and destruction by existing firms, suggesting that positive local shocks accelerate churn."
Finance and Growth at the Firm Level: Evidence from SBA Loans,J. DAVID BROWN,24 January 2017,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12492,"ABSTRACTWe analyze linked databases on all SBA loans and lenders and on all U.S. employers to estimate the effects of financial access on employment growth. Estimation exploits the long panels and variation in local availability of SBA-intensive lenders. The results imply an increase of 3–3.5 jobs for each million dollars of loans, suggesting real effects of credit constraints. Estimated impacts are stronger for younger and larger firms and when local credit conditions are weak, but we find no clear evidence of cyclical variation. We estimate taxpayer costs per job created in the range of $21,000–$25,000."
Forced Asset Sales and the Concentration of Outstanding Debt: Evidence from the Mortgage Market,GIOVANNI FAVARA,24 January 2017,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12494,"ABSTRACTWe provide evidence that lenders differ in their ex post incentives to internalize price-default externalities associated with the liquidation of collateralized debt. Using the mortgage market as a laboratory, we conjecture that lenders with a large share of outstanding mortgages on their balance sheets internalize the negative spillovers associated with the liquidation of defaulting mortgages and thus are less inclined to foreclose. We provide evidence consistent with our conjecture. Arguably as a consequence, zip codes with a higher concentration of outstanding mortgages experience smaller house prices declines. These results are not driven by unobservable zip code or lender characteristics."
Liquidity in a Market for Unique Assets: Specified Pool and To-Be-Announced Trading in the Mortgage-Backed Securities Market,PENGJIE GAO,25 January 2017,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12496,"ABSTRACTAgency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) trade simultaneously in a market for specified pools (SPs) and in the to-be-announced (TBA) forward market. TBA trading creates liquidity by allowing thousands of different MBS to be traded in a handful of TBA contracts. SPs that are eligible to be traded as TBAs have significantly lower trading costs than other SPs. We present evidence that TBA eligibility, in addition to characteristics of TBA-eligible SPs, lowers trading costs. We show that dealers hedge SP inventory with TBA trades, and they are more likely to prearrange trades in SPs that are difficult to hedge."
The Effect of Housing on Portfolio Choice,RAJ CHETTY,03 February 2017,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12500,"ABSTRACTWe show that characterizing the effects of housing on portfolios requires distinguishing between the effects of home equity and mortgage debt. We isolate exogenous variation in home equity and mortgages by using differences across housing markets in house prices and housing supply elasticities as instruments. Increases in property value (holding home equity constant) reduce stockholdings, while increases in home equity wealth (holding property value constant) raise stockholdings. The stock share of liquid wealth would rise by 1 percentage point—6% of the mean stock share—if a household were to spend 10% less on its house, holding fixed wealth."
Exchange Rates and Monetary Policy Uncertainty,PHILIPPE MUELLER,02 February 2017,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12499,"ABSTRACTWe document that a trading strategy that is short the U.S. dollar and long other currencies exhibits significantly larger excess returns on days with scheduled Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announcements. We show that these excess returns (i) are higher for currencies with higher interest rate differentials vis-à-vis the United States, (ii) increase with uncertainty about monetary policy, and (iii) increase further when the Federal Reserve adopts a policy of monetary easing. We interpret these excess returns as compensation for monetary policy uncertainty within a parsimonious model of constrained financiers who intermediate global demand for currencies."
Correlated Default and Financial Intermediation,GREGORY PHELAN,24 January 2017,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12493,"ABSTRACTFinancial intermediation naturally arises when knowing how loan payoffs are correlated is valuable for managing investments but lenders cannot easily observe that relationship. I show this result using a costly enforcement model in which lenders need ex post incentives to enforce payments from defaulted loans and borrowers' payoffs are correlated. When projects have correlated outcomes, learning the state of one project (via enforcement) provides information about the states of other projects. A large correlated portfolio provides ex post incentives for enforcement. Thus, intermediation dominates direct lending, and intermediaries are financed with risk-free deposits, earn positive profits, and hold systemic default risk."
"Does the Scope of the Sell-Side Analyst Industry Matter? An Examination of Bias, Accuracy, and Information Content of Analyst Reports",KENNETH MERKLEY,20 January 2017,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12485,"ABSTRACTWe examine changes in the scope of the sell-side analyst industry and whether these changes impact information dissemination and the quality of analysts’ reports. Our findings suggest that changes in the number of analysts covering an industry impact analyst competition and have significant spillover effects on other analysts’ forecast accuracy, bias, report informativeness, and effort. These spillover industry effects are incremental to the effects of firm level changes in analyst coverage. Overall, a more significant sell-side analyst industry presence has positive externalities that can result in better functioning capital markets."
Short-Term Market Risks Implied by Weekly Options,TORBEN G. ANDERSEN,23 February 2017,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12486,"ABSTRACTWe study short-maturity (“weekly”) S&P 500 index options, which provide a direct way to analyze volatility and jump risks. Unlike longer-dated options, they are largely insensitive to the risk of intertemporal shifts in the economic environment. Adopting a novel seminonparametric approach, we uncover variation in the negative jump tail risk, which is not spanned by market volatility and helps predict future equity returns. As such, our approach allows for easy identification of periods of heightened concerns about negative tail events that are not always “signaled” by the level of market volatility and elude standard asset pricing models."
Attracting Early-Stage Investors: Evidence from a Randomized Field Experiment,SHAI BERNSTEIN,20 September 2016,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12470,"ABSTRACTThis paper uses a randomized field experiment to identify which start-up characteristics are most important to investors in early-stage firms. The experiment randomizes investors’ information sets of fund-raising start-ups. The average investor responds strongly to information about the founding team, but not to firm traction or existing lead investors. We provide evidence that the team is not merely a signal of quality, and that investing based on team information is a rational strategy. Together, our results indicate that information about human assets is causally important for the funding of early-stage firms and hence for entrepreneurial success."
Politically Connected Private Equity and Employment,MARA FACCIO,20 January 2017,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12483,"ABSTRACTWe investigate the employment consequences of private equity buyouts. We find evidence of higher job creation, on average, at the establishments operated by targets of politically connected private equity firms than at those operated by targets of nonconnected private equity firms. Consistent with an exchange of favors story, establishments operated by targets of politically connected private equity firms increase employment more during election years and in states with high levels of corruption. In additional analyses, we provide evidence of specific benefits experienced by target firms from their political connections. Our results are robust to tests designed to mitigate selection concerns."
Mortgage Debt Overhang: Reduced Investment by Homeowners at Risk of Default,BRIAN T. MELZER,20 January 2017,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12482,"ABSTRACTHomeowners at risk of default face a debt overhang that reduces their incentive to invest in their property: in expectation, some value created by investments in the property will go to the lender. This agency conflict affects housing investments. Homeowners at risk of default cut back substantially on home improvements and mortgage principal payments, even when they appear financially unconstrained. Meanwhile, they do not reduce spending on assets that they may retain in default, including home appliances, furniture, and vehicles. These findings highlight an important financial friction that has stifled housing investment since the Great Recession."
Bank Leverage and Monetary Policy's Risk-Taking Channel: Evidence from the United States,GIOVANNI DELL'ARICCIA,20 September 2016,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12467,"ABSTRACTWe present evidence of a risk-taking channel of monetary policy for the U.S. banking system. We use confidential data on banks’ internal ratings on loans to businesses over the period 1997 to 2011 from the Federal Reserve's Survey of Terms of Business Lending. We find that ex ante risk-taking by banks (measured by the risk rating of new loans) is negatively associated with increases in short-term interest rates. This relationship is more pronounced in regions that are less in sync with the nationwide business cycle, and less pronounced for banks with relatively low capital or during periods of financial distress."
Linear-Rational Term Structure Models,DAMIR FILIPOVIĆ,16 December 2016,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12488,"ABSTRACTWe introduce the class of linear-rational term structure models in which the state price density is modeled such that bond prices become linear-rational functions of the factors. This class is highly tractable with several distinct advantages: (i) ensures nonnegative interest rates, (ii) easily accommodates unspanned factors affecting volatility and risk premiums, and (iii) admits semi-analytical solutions to swaptions. A parsimonious model specification within the linear-rational class has a very good fit to both interest rate swaps and swaptions since 1997 and captures many features of term structure, volatility, and risk premium dynamics—including when interest rates are close to the zero lower bound."
Asset Market Participation and Portfolio Choice over the Life-Cycle,ANDREAS FAGERENG,20 January 2017,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12484,"ABSTRACTUsing error-free data on life-cycle portfolio allocations of a large sample of Norwegian households, we document a double adjustment as households age: a rebalancing of the portfolio composition away from stocks as they approach retirement and stock market exit after retirement. When structurally estimating an extended life-cycle model, the parameter combination that best fits the data is one with a relatively large risk aversion, a small per-period participation cost, and a yearly probability of a large stock market loss in line with the frequency of stock market crashes in Norway."
Before an Analyst Becomes an Analyst: Does Industry Experience Matter?,DANIEL BRADLEY,20 September 2016,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12466,"ABSTRACTUsing hand-collected biographical information on financial analysts from 1983 to 2011, we find that analysts making forecasts on firms in industries related to their preanalyst experience have better forecast accuracy, evoke stronger market reactions to earning revisions, and are more likely to be namedInstitutional Investorall-stars. Plausibly exogenous losses of analysts with related industry experience have real financial market implications—changes in firms’ information asymmetry and price reactions are significantly larger than those of other analysts. Overall, industry expertise acquired from preanalyst work experience is valuable to analysts, consistent with the emphasis placed on their industry knowledge by institutional investors."
Precautionary Savings with Risky Assets: When Cash Is Not Cash,RAN DUCHIN,19 December 2016,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12490,"ABSTRACTU.S. industrial firms invest heavily in noncash, risky financial assets such as corporate debt, equity, and mortgage-backed securities. Risky assets represent 40% of firms’ financial portfolios, or 6% of total book assets. We present a formal model to assess the optimality of this behavior. Consistent with the model, risky assets are concentrated in financially unconstrained firms holding large financial portfolios, are held by poorly governed firms, and are discounted by 13% to 22% compared to safe assets. We conclude that this activity represents an unregulated asset management industry of more than $1.5 trillion, questioning the traditional boundaries of nonfinancial firms."
On the Foundations of Corporate Social Responsibility,HAO LIANG,06 December 2016,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12487,"ABSTRACTUsing corporate social responsibility (CSR) ratings for 23,000 companies from 114 countries, we find that a firm's CSR rating and its country's legal origin are strongly correlated. Legal origin is a stronger explanation than “doing good by doing well” factors or firm and country characteristics (ownership concentration, political institutions, and globalization): firms from common law countries have lower CSR than companies from civil law countries, with Scandinavian civil law firms having the highest CSR ratings. Evidence from quasi-natural experiments such as scandals and natural disasters suggests that civil law firms are more responsive to CSR shocks than common law firms."
Reverse Mortgage Loans: A Quantitative Analysis,MAKOTO NAKAJIMA,13 December 2016,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12489,"ABSTRACTReverse mortgage loans (RMLs) allow older homeowners to borrow against housing wealth without moving. Despite rapid growth in this market, only 1.9% of eligible homeowners had RMLs in 2013. In this paper, we analyze reverse mortgages in a calibrated life-cycle model of retirement. The average welfare gain from RMLs is $252 per homeowner, and $1,770 per RML borrower. Bequest motives, uncertainty about health and expenses, and loan costs account for low demand. According to the model, the Great Recession's impact differs across age, income, and wealth distributions, with a threefold increase in RML demand for lowest income and oldest households."
Who Are the Value and Growth Investors?,SEBASTIEN BETERMIER,23 October 2016,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12473,"ABSTRACTThis paper investigates value and growth investing in a large administrative panel of Swedish residents. We show that, over the life cycle, households progressively shift from growth to value as they become older and their balance sheets improve. Furthermore, investors with high human capital and high exposure to macroeconomic risk tilt their portfolios away from value. While several behavioral biases seem evident in the data, the patterns we uncover are overall remarkably consistent with the portfolio implications of risk-based theories of the value premium."
Asset Pricing without Garbage,TIM A. KROENCKE,04 August 2016,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12438,"ABSTRACTThis paper provides an explanation for why garbage implies a much lower relative risk aversion in the consumption-based asset pricing model than National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) consumption expenditure: Unlike garbage, NIPA consumption is filtered to mitigate measurement error. I apply a simple model of the filtering process that allows one to undo the filtering inherent in NIPA consumption. “Unfiltered NIPA consumption” well explains the equity premium and is priced in the cross-section of stock returns. I discuss the likely properties of true consumption (i.e., without measurement error and filtering) and quantify implications for habit and long-run risk models."
Housing Collateral and Entrepreneurship,MARTIN C. SCHMALZ,21 September 2016,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12468,"ABSTRACTWe show that collateral constraints restrict firm entry and postentry growth, using French administrative data and cross-sectional variation in local house-price appreciation as shocks to collateral values. We control for local demand shocks by comparing treated homeowners to controls in the same region that do not experience collateral shocks: renters and homeowners with an outstanding mortgage, who (in France) cannot take out a second mortgage. In both comparisons, an increase in collateral value leads to a higher probability of becoming an entrepreneur. Conditional on entry, treated entrepreneurs use more debt, start larger firms, and remain larger in the long run."
Formative Experiences and Portfolio Choice: Evidence from the Finnish Great Depression,SAMULI KNÜPFER,20 September 2016,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12469,"ABSTRACTWe trace the impact of formative experiences on portfolio choice. Plausibly exogenous variation in workers’ exposure to a depression allows us to identify the effects and a new estimation approach makes addressing wealth and income effects possible. We find that adversely affected workers are less likely to invest in risky assets. This result is robust to a number of control variables and it holds for individuals whose income, employment, and wealth were unaffected. The effects travel through social networks: individuals whose neighbors and family members experienced adverse circumstances also avoid risky investments."
What Doesn't Kill You Will Only Make You More Risk-Loving: Early-Life Disasters and CEO Behavior,GENNARO BERNILE,27 May 2016,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12432,"ABSTRACTThe literature on managerial style posits a linear relation between a chief executive officer's (CEOs) past experiences and firm risk. We show that there is a nonmonotonic relation between the intensity of CEOs’ early-life exposure to fatal disasters and corporate risk-taking. CEOs who experience fatal disasters without extremely negative consequences lead firms that behave more aggressively, whereas CEOs who witness the extreme downside of disasters behave more conservatively. These patterns manifest across various corporate policies including leverage, cash holdings, and acquisition activity. Ultimately, the link between CEOs’ disaster experience and corporate policies has real economic consequences on firm riskiness and cost of capital."
Resident Networks and Corporate Connections: Evidence from World War II Internment Camps,LAUREN COHEN,01 March 2016,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12407,"ABSTRACTUsing customs and port authority data, we show that firms are significantly more likely to trade with countries that have a large resident population near their firm headquarters, and that these connected trades are their most valuable international trades. Using the formation of World War II Japanese internment camps to isolate exogenous shocks to local ethnic populations, we identify a causal link between local networks and firm trade. Firms are also more likely to acquire target firms, and report increased segment sales, in connected countries. Our results point to a surprisingly large role of immigrants as economic conduits for firms."
The Real Effects of Credit Ratings: The Sovereign Ceiling Channel,HEITOR ALMEIDA,02 June 2016,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12434,"ABSTRACTWe show that sovereign debt impairments can have a significant effect on financial markets and real economies through a credit ratings channel. Specifically, we find that firms reduce their investment and reliance on credit markets due to a rising cost of debt capital following a sovereign rating downgrade. We identify these effects by exploiting exogenous variation in corporate ratings due to rating agencies' sovereign ceiling policies, which require that firms' ratings remain at or below the sovereign rating of their country of domicile."
Financial Contracting and Organizational Form: Evidence from the Regulation of Trade Credit,EMILY BREZA,04 August 2016,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12439,"ABSTRACTWe present evidence that restrictions to the set of feasible financial contracts affect buyer-supplier relationships and the organizational form of the firm. We exploit a regulation that restricted the maturity of the trade credit contracts that a large retailer could sign with some of its small suppliers. Using a within-product difference-in-differences identification strategy, we find that the restriction reduces the likelihood of trade by 11%. The retailer also responds by internalizing procurement to its own subsidiaries and reducing overall purchases. Finally, we find that relational contracts can mitigate the inability to extend long trade credit terms."
Buyout Activity: The Impact of Aggregate Discount Rates,VALENTIN HADDAD,19 September 2016,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12464,"ABSTRACTBuyout booms form in response to declines in the aggregate risk premium. We document that the equity risk premium is the primary determinant of buyout activity rather than credit-specific conditions. We articulate a simple explanation for this phenomenon: a low risk premium increases the present value of performance gains and decreases the cost of holding an illiquid investment. A panel of U.S. buyouts confirms this view. The risk premium shapes changes in buyout characteristics over the cycle, including their riskiness, leverage, and performance. Our results underscore the importance of the risk premium in corporate finance decisions."
Asset Pricing with Countercyclical Household Consumption Risk,GEORGE M. CONSTANTINIDES,21 September 2016,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12471,"ABSTRACTWe show that shocks to household consumption growth are negatively skewed, persistent, countercyclical, and drive asset prices. We construct a parsimonious model where heterogeneous households have recursive preferences. A single state variable drives the conditional cross-sectional moments of household consumption growth. The estimated model fits well the unconditional cross-sectional moments of household consumption growth and the moments of the risk-free rate, equity premium, price-dividend ratio, and aggregate dividend and consumption growth. The model-implied risk-free rate and price-dividend ratio are procyclical, while the market return has countercyclical mean and variance. Finally, household consumption risk explains the cross section of excess returns."
"Local Risk, Local Factors, and Asset Prices",SELALE TUZEL,19 September 2016,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12465,"ABSTRACTFirm location affects firm risk through local factor prices. We find more procyclical factor prices such as wages and real estate prices in areas with more cyclical economies, namely, high “local beta” areas. While procyclical wages provide a natural hedge against aggregate shocks and reduce firm risk, procyclical prices of real estate, which are part of firm assets, increase firm risk. We confirm that firms located in higher local beta areas have lower industry-adjusted returns and conditional betas, and show that the effect is stronger among firms with low real estate holdings. A production-based equilibrium model explains these empirical findings."
Ex-Dividend Profitability and Institutional Trading Skill,TYLER R. HENRY,26 September 2016,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12472,"ABSTRACTWe use institutional trading data to examine whether skilled institutions exploit positive abnormal ex-dividend returns. Results show that institutions concentrate trading around certain ex-dates, and earn higher profits around these events. Dividend capture trades represent 6% of all institutional buy trades but contribute 15% of overall abnormal returns. Institutional dividend capture trading is persistent. Institutional ex-day profitability is also strongly cross-sectionally related to trade execution skill. The relation between execution skill and profits disappears around placebo non-ex-days. Results suggest that skilled institutions target certain opportunities rather than benefiting uniformly over time. Furthermore, only skilled institutions can profit from dividend capture."
Do ETFs Increase Volatility?,ITZHAK BEN-DAVID,22 September 2018,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12727,"ABSTRACTDue to their low trading costs, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are a potential catalyst for short-horizon liquidity traders. The liquidity shocks can propagate to the underlying securities through the arbitrage channel, and ETFs may increase the nonfundamental volatility of the securities in their baskets. We exploit exogenous changes in index membership and find that stocks with higher ETF ownership display significantly higher volatility. ETF ownership increases the negative autocorrelation in stock prices. The increase in volatility appears to introduce undiversifiable risk in prices because stocks with high ETF ownership earn a significant risk premium of up to 56 basis points monthly."
Unscheduled News and Market Dynamics,JÉRÔME DUGAST,09 August 2018,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12717,"ABSTRACTWhen unscheduled news arrives, investors react with a stochastic delay yet still may exploit new information. In this context, I study the equilibrium dynamics of limit order markets. Continuous idiosyncratic liquidity shocks result in trades on both sides of the order book. News therefore arrives at random times. Following news, order flows become unbalanced and market depth is consumed, leading to positive covariance between price variability, trading volume, and order book unbalances. Holding the unconditional price variability constant, news frequency has a negative effect on both market depth and the variability-volume covariance."
Arrested Development: Theory and Evidence of Supply-Side Speculation in the Housing Market,CHARLES G. NATHANSON,29 August 2018,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12719,"ABSTRACTThis paper studies the role of disagreement in amplifying housing cycles. Speculation is easier in the land market than in the housing market due to frictions that make renting less efficient than owner-occupancy. As a result, undeveloped land facilitates construction and intensifies the speculation that causes booms and busts in house prices. This observation challenges the standard intuition that in cities where construction is easier, house price booms are smaller. It can also explain why the largest house price booms in the United States between 2000 and 2006 occurred in areas with elastic housing supply."
Influencing Control: Jawboning in Risk Arbitrage,WEI JIANG,09 August 2018,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12721,"ABSTRACTIn an “activist risk arbitrage,” a shareholder attempts to improve terms of an announced M&A through public campaigns. Activists target deals with low premiums and those susceptible to managerial conflicts of interest, including going-private deals and deals in which CEOs receive outsized payments. Activist arbitrageurs are associated with a significant decrease in the probability that targets will be sold to the announced bidders, and an increase in the premium paid, both ex post among surviving deals and ex ante among all deals. Activist arbitrage serves as a governance mechanism in M&A and earns higher returns than passive arbitrage."
The Politics of Foreclosures,SUMIT AGARWAL,22 September 2018,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12725,"ABSTRACTThe U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services Committee considered many important banking reforms in 2009 to 2010. We show that, during this period, foreclosure starts on delinquent mortgages were delayed in the districts of committee members although there was no difference in delinquency rates between committee and noncommittee districts. In these areas, banks delayed the foreclosure starts by 0.5 months (relative to the 12-month average). The estimated cost of delay to lenders is an order of magnitude greater than the campaign contributions by the political action committees of the largest mortgage servicing banks to the committee members in that period."
Currency Risk Factors in a Recursive Multicountry Economy,RIC COLACITO,09 August 2018,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12720,"ABSTRACTFocusing on the 10 most traded currencies, we provide empirical evidence regarding a significant heterogeneous exposure to global growth news shocks. We incorporate this empirical fact in a frictionless risk-sharing model with recursive preferences, multiple countries, and multiple consumption goods whose supply features both global and local short- and long-run shocks. Since news shocks are priced, heterogeneous exposure to long-lasting global growth shocks results in a relevant reallocation of international resources and currency adjustments. Our unified framework replicates the properties of the HML-FX and HML-NFA carry-trade strategies studied by Lustig, Roussanov, and Verdelhan and Della Corte, Riddiough, and Sarno."
Collateral Constraints and the Law of One Price: An Experiment,MARCO CIPRIANI,28 September 2018,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12722,"ABSTRACTWe test the asset pricing implications of collateralized borrowing (that is, of using assets as collateral to borrow money) in the laboratory. To this purpose, we develop a general equilibrium model with collateral constraints amenable to laboratory implementation and gather experimental data. In the laboratory, assets that can be leveraged fetch higher prices than assets that cannot, even though assets' payoffs are identical in all states of the world. Collateral value, therefore, creates deviations from the Law of One Price. The spread between collateralizeable and noncollateralizeable assets is significant and quantitatively close to theoretical predictions."
The Impact of Bank Credit on Labor Reallocation and Aggregate Industry Productivity,JOHN (JIANQIU) BAI,17 September 2018,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12726,"ABSTRACTWe provide evidence that the deregulation of U.S. state banking markets leads to a significant increase in the relative employment and capital growth of local firms with higher productivity, and that this effect is concentrated among young firms. Using financial data for a broad range of firms, our analysis suggests that this effect is driven by a shift in the composition of local bank credit supply toward more productive firms. We estimate that this effect translates into economically important gains in aggregate industry productivity and that changes in the allocation of labor play a central role in driving these gains."
Noncognitive Abilities and Financial Delinquency: The Role of Self-Efficacy in Avoiding Financial Distress,CAMELIA M. KUHNEN,23 September 2018,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12724,"ABSTRACTWe investigate a novel determinant of financial distress, namely, individuals' self-efficacy, or belief that their actions can influence the future. Individuals with high self-efficacy are more likely to take precautions that mitigate adverse financial shocks. They are subsequently less likely to default on their debt and bill payments, especially after experiencing negative shocks such as job loss or illness. Thus, noncognitive abilities are an important determinant of financial fragility and subjective expectations are an important factor in household financial decisions."
Sensation Seeking and Hedge Funds,STEPHEN BROWN,17 September 2018,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12723,"ABSTRACTWe show that, motivated by sensation seeking, hedge fund managers who own powerful sports cars take on more investment risk but do not deliver higher returns, resulting in lower Sharpe ratios, information ratios, and alphas. Moreover, sensation-seeking managers trade more frequently, actively, and unconventionally, and prefer lottery-like stocks. We show further that some investors are themselves susceptible to sensation seeking and that sensation-seeking investors fuel the demand for sensation-seeking managers. While investors perceive sensation seekers to be less competent, they do not fully appreciate the superior investment skills of sensation-avoiding fund managers."
AMERICAN FINANCE ASSOCIATION,Kenneth Singleton,29 November 2018,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12742,
Anomalies and News,JOSEPH ENGELBERG,09 August 2018,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12718,"ABSTRACTUsing a sample of 97 stock return anomalies, we find that anomaly returns are 50% higher on corporate news days and six times higher on earnings announcement days. These results could be explained by dynamic risk, mispricing due to biased expectations, or data mining. We develop and conduct several unique tests to differentiate between these three explanations. Our results are most consistent with the idea that anomaly returns are driven by biased expectations, which are at least partly corrected upon news arrival."
Can Innovation Help U.S. Manufacturing Firms Escape Import Competition from China?,JOHAN HOMBERT,05 June 2018,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12691,"ABSTRACTWe study whether R&D-intensive firms are more resilient to trade shocks. We correct for the endogeneity of R&D using tax-induced changes to R&D costs. While rising imports from China lead to slower sales growth and lower profitability, these effects are significantly smaller for firms with a larger stock of R&D (about half when moving from the bottom quartile to the top quartile of R&D). We provide evidence that this effect is explained by R&D allowing firms to increase product differentiation. As a result, while firms in import-competing industries cut capital expenditures and employment, R&D-intensive firms downsize considerably less."
Political Representation and Governance: Evidence from the Investment Decisions of Public Pension Funds,ALEKSANDAR ANDONOV,19 June 2018,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12706,"ABSTRACTRepresentation on pension fund boards by state officials—often determined by statute decades past—is negatively related to the performance of private equity investments made by the pension fund, despite state officials’ relatively strong financial education and experience. Their underperformance appears to be partly driven by poor investment decisions consistent with political expediency, and is also positively related to political contributions from the finance industry. Boards dominated by elected rank-and-file plan participants also underperform, but to a smaller extent and due to these trustees’ lesser financial experience."
The Geography of Financial Misconduct,CHRISTOPHER A. PARSONS,19 June 2018,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12704,"ABSTRACTFinancial misconduct (FM) rates differ widely between major U.S. cities, up to a factor of 3. Although spatial differences in enforcement and firm characteristics do not account for these patterns, city-level norms appear to be very important. For example, FM rates are strongly related to other unethical behavior, involving politicians, doctors, and (potentially unfaithful) spouses, in the city."
Expected Inflation and Other Determinants of Treasury Yields,GREGORY R. DUFFEE,19 June 2018,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12700,"ABSTRACTShocks to nominal bond yields consist of news about expected future inflation, expected future real short rates, and expected excess returns—all over the bond's life. I estimate the magnitude of the first component for short- and long-maturity Treasury bonds. At a quarterly frequency, variances of news about expected inflation account for between 10% to 20% of variances of yield shocks. Standard dynamic models with long-run risk imply variance ratios close to 1. Habit formation models fare somewhat better. The magnitudes of shocks to real rates and expected excess returns cannot be determined reliably."
Asset Management within Commercial Banking Groups: International Evidence,MIGUEL A. FERREIRA,19 June 2018,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12702,"ABSTRACTWe study the performance of equity mutual funds run by asset management divisions of commercial banking groups using a worldwide sample. We show that bank-affiliated funds underperform unaffiliated funds by 92 basis points per year. Consistent with conflicts of interest, the underperformance is more pronounced among those affiliated funds that overweight the stock of the bank's lending clients to a great extent. Divestitures of asset management divisions by banking groups support a causal interpretation of the results. Our findings suggest that affiliated fund managers support their lending divisions’ operations to reduce career concerns at the expense of fund investors."
Does Herding Behavior Reveal Skill? An Analysis of Mutual Fund Performance,HAO JIANG,19 June 2018,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12699,"ABSTRACTWe uncover a negative relation between herding behavior and skill in the mutual fund industry. Our new, dynamic measure of fund-level herding captures the tendency of fund managers to follow the trades of the institutional crowd. We find that herding funds underperform their antiherding peers by over 2% per year. Differences in skill drive this performance gap: Antiherding funds make superior investment decisions even on stocks not heavily traded by institutions, and can anticipate the trades of the crowd; furthermore, the herding-antiherding performance gap is persistent, wider when skill is more valuable, and larger among managers with stronger career concerns."
Rankings and Risk-Taking in the Finance Industry,MICHAEL KIRCHLER,19 June 2018,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12701,"ABSTRACTRankings are omnipresent in the finance industry, yet the literature is silent on how they impact financial professionals' behavior. Using lab-in-the-field experiments with 657 professionals and lab experiments with 432 students, we investigate how rank incentives affect investment decisions. We find that both rank and tournament incentives increase risk-taking among underperforming professionals, while only tournament incentives affect students. This rank effect is robust to the experimental frame (investment frame vs. abstract frame), to payoff consequences (own return vs. family return), to social identity priming (private identity vs. professional identity), and to professionals' gender (no gender differences among professionals)."
Quid Pro Quo? What Factors Influence IPO Allocations to Investors?,TIM JENKINSON,19 June 2018,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12703,"ABSTRACTUsing data from all of the leading international investment banks on 220 initial public offerings (IPOs) raising $160 billion between January 2010 and May 2015, we test the determinants of IPO allocations. We compare investors’ IPO allocations with proxies for their information production during bookbuilding and the broking (and other) revenues they generate for bookrunners. We find evidence consistent with information revelation theories. We also find strong support for the existence of a quid pro quo whereby broking revenues are a significant determinant of investors’ IPO allocations and profits. The quid pro quo remains when we control for unobserved investor characteristics and investor-bank relationships."
Do Rare Events Explain CDX Tranche Spreads?,SANG BYUNG SEO,09 August 2018,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12705,"ABSTRACTWe investigate whether a model with time-varying probability of economic disaster can explain prices of collateralized debt obligations. We focus on senior tranches of the CDX, an index of credit default swaps on investment grade firms. These assets do not incur losses until a large fraction of previously stable firms default, and thus are deep out-of-the money put options on the overall economy. When calibrated to consumption data and to the equity premium, the model explains the spreads on CDX tranches prior to and during the 2008 to 2009 crisis."
Creditor Control Rights and Board Independence,DANIEL FERREIRA,21 May 2018,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12692,"ABSTRACTWe find that the number of independent directors on corporate boards increases by approximately 24% following financial covenant violations in credit agreements. Most of these new directors have links to creditors. Firms that appoint new directors after violations are more likely to issue new equity, and to decrease payout, operational risk, and CEO cash compensation, than firms without such appointments. We conclude that a firm's board composition, governance, and policies are shaped by current and past credit agreements."
CMBS and Conflicts of Interest: Evidence from Ownership Changes for Servicers,MAISY WONG,08 May 2018,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12690,"ABSTRACTSelf-dealing is potentially important but difficult to measure. In this paper, I study special servicers in commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), which sell distressed assets on behalf of bondholders. Around 2010, ownership changes of four major servicers raised concerns that they may direct benefits to new owners' affiliates (buyers and service providers). Loans liquidated after ownership changes have greater loss rates than before (8 percentage points (p.p.), $2.3 billion in losses), relative to other (placebo) servicers. Together with a case study that tracks self-dealing purchases, the findings point to potential steering conflicts that could incentivize tunneling through fees to service providers."
Presidential Address: Pension Policy and the Financial System,DAVID S. SCHARFSTEIN,24 August 2018,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12710,"ABSTRACTIn this paper, I examine the effect of pension policy on the structure of financial systems around the world. In particular, I explore the hypothesis that policies that promote pension savings also promote the development of capital markets. I present a model that endogenizes the extent to which savings are intermediated through banks or capital markets, and derive implications for corporate finance, household finance, banking, and the size of the financial sector. I then present a number of facts that are broadly consistent with the theory and examine a variety of alternative explanations of my findings."
Anticompetitive Effects of Common Ownership,JOSÉ AZAR,25 May 2018,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12698,"ABSTRACTMany natural competitors are jointly held by a small set of large institutional investors. In the U.S. airline industry, taking common ownership into account implies increases in market concentration that are 10 times larger than what is “presumed likely to enhance market power” by antitrust authorities.1Within-route changes in common ownership concentration robustly correlate with route-level changes in ticket prices, even when we only use variation in ownership due to the combination of two large asset managers. We conclude that a hidden social cost—reduced product market competition—accompanies the private benefits of diversification and good governance."
A Tough Act to Follow: Contrast Effects in Financial Markets,SAMUEL M. HARTZMARK,16 April 2018,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12685,"ABSTRACTA contrast effect occurs when the value of a previously observed signal inversely biases perception of the next signal. We present the first evidence that contrast effects can distort prices in sophisticated and liquid markets. Investors mistakenly perceive earnings news today as more impressive if yesterday's earnings surprise was bad and less impressive if yesterday's surprise was good. A unique advantage of our financial setting is that we can identify contrast effects as an error in perceptions rather than expectations. Finally, we show that our results cannot be explained by an alternative explanation involving information transmission from previous earnings announcements."
Capital Commitment and Illiquidity in Corporate Bonds,HENDRIK BESSEMBINDER,14 May 2018,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12694,"ABSTRACTWe study trading costs and dealer behavior in U.S. corporate bond markets from 2006 to 2016. Despite a temporary spike during the financial crisis, average trade execution costs have not increased notably over time. However, dealer capital commitment, turnover, block trade frequency, and average trade size decreased during the financial crisis and thereafter. These declines are attributable to bank-affiliated dealers, as nonbank dealers have increased their market commitment. Our evidence indicates that liquidity provision in the corporate bond markets is evolving away from the commitment of bank-affiliated dealer capital to absorb customer imbalances, and that postcrisis banking regulations likely contribute."
Efficiently Inefficient Markets for Assets and Asset Management,NICOLAE GÂRLEANU,11 May 2018,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12696,"ABSTRACTWe consider a model where investors can invest directly or search for an asset manager, information about assets is costly, and managers charge an endogenous fee. The efficiency of asset prices is linked to the efficiency of the asset management market: if investors can find managers more easily, more money is allocated to active management, fees are lower, and asset prices are more efficient. Informed managers outperform after fees, uninformed managers underperform, while the average manager's performance depends on the number of “noise allocators.” Small investors should remain uninformed, but large and sophisticated investors benefit from searching for informed active managers since their search cost is low relative to capital. Hence, managers with larger and more sophisticated investors are expected to outperform."
The Dynamics of Financially Constrained Arbitrage,DENIS GROMB,09 May 2018,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12689,"ABSTRACTWe develop a model in which financially constrained arbitrageurs exploit price discrepancies across segmented markets. We show that the dynamics of arbitrage capital are self-correcting: following a shock that depletes capital, returns increase, which allows capital to be gradually replenished. Spreads increase more for trades with volatile fundamentals or more time to convergence. Arbitrageurs cut their positions more in those trades, except when volatility concerns the hedgeable component. Financial constraints yield a positive cross-sectional relationship between spreads/returns and betas with respect to arbitrage capital. Diversification of arbitrageurs across markets induces contagion, but generally lowers arbitrageurs' risk and price volatility."
Estimating Private Equity Returns from Limited Partner Cash Flows,ANDREW ANG,10 May 2018,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12688,ABSTRACTWe introduce a methodology to estimate the historical time series of returns to investment in private equity funds. The approach requires only an unbalanced panel of cash contributions and distributions accruing to limited partners and is robust to sparse data. We decompose private equity returns from 1994 to 2015 into a component due to traded factors and a time-varying private equity premium not spanned by publicly traded factors. We find cyclicality in private equity returns that differs according to fund type and is consistent with the conjecture that capital market segmentation contributes to private equity returns.
Networks in Production: Asset Pricing Implications,BERNARD HERSKOVIC,16 April 2018,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12684,"ABSTRACTIn this paper, I examine asset pricing in a multisector model with sectors connected through an input-output network. Changes in the network are sources of systematic risk reflected in equilibrium asset prices. Two characteristics of the network matter for asset prices: network concentration and network sparsity. These two production-based asset pricing factors are determined by the structure of the network and are computed from input-output data. Consistent with the model predictions, I find return spreads of 4.6% and −3.2% per year on sparsity and concentration beta-sorted portfolios, respectively."
Can Taxes Shape an Industry? Evidence from the Implementation of the “Amazon Tax”,BRIAN BAUGH,20 April 2018,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12687,"ABSTRACTFor years, online retailers have maintained a price advantage over brick-and-mortar retailers by not collecting sales tax at the time of sale. Recently, several states have required that online retailer Amazon collect sales tax during checkout. Using transaction-level data, we document that households living in these states reduced their Amazon purchases by 9.4% following the implementation of the sales tax laws, implying elasticities of –1.2 to –1.4. The effect is stronger for large purchases, where purchases declined by 29.1%, corresponding to an elasticity of –3.9. Studying competitors in the electronics field, we find some evidence of substitution toward competing retailers."
An Experimental Study of Bond Market Pricing,MATTHIAS WEBER,10 May 2018,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12695,"ABSTRACTAn important feature of bond markets is the relationship between the initial public offering (IPO) price and the probability that the issuer defaults. On the one hand, the default probability affects the IPO price; on the other hand, the IPO price affects the default probability. It is a priori unclear whether agents can competitively price such assets. Our paper is the first to explore this question. To do so, we use laboratory experiments. We develop two flexible bond market models that are easily implemented in the laboratory. We find that subjects learn to price the bonds well after only a few repetitions."
On the Asset Allocation of a Default Pension Fund,MAGNUS DAHLQUIST,10 May 2018,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12697,"ABSTRACTWe characterize the optimal default fund in a defined contribution (DC) pension plan. Using detailed data on individuals' holdings inside and outside the pension system, we find substantial heterogeneity within and between passive and active investors in terms of labor income, financial wealth, and stock market participation. We build a life-cycle consumption-savings model, with a DC pension account and an opt-out/default choice, that produces realistic investor heterogeneity. Relative to a common age-based allocation, implementing the optimal default asset allocation implies a welfare gain of 1.5% during retirement. Much of the gain is attainable with a simple rule of thumb."
Report of the Editor of the Journal of Finance for the Year 2017,STEFAN NAGEL,24 August 2018,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12708,
Deviations from Covered Interest Rate Parity,WENXIN DU,19 February 2018,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12620,"ABSTRACTWe find that deviations from the covered interest rate parity (CIP) condition imply large, persistent, and systematic arbitrage opportunities in one of the largest asset markets in the world. Contrary to the common view, these deviations for major currencies are not explained away by credit risk or transaction costs. They are particularly strong for forward contracts that appear on banks' balance sheets at the end of the quarter, pointing to a causal effect of banking regulation on asset prices. The CIP deviations also appear significantly correlated with other fixed income spreads and with nominal interest rates."
Is Sell-Side Research More Valuable in Bad Times?,ROGER K. LOH,07 February 2018,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12611,"ABSTRACTBecause uncertainty is high in bad times, investors find it harder to assess firm prospects and hence should value analyst output more. However, higher uncertainty makes analysts’ tasks harder, so it is unclear whether analyst output is more valuable in bad times. We find that in bad times, analyst revisions have a larger stock-price impact, earnings forecast errors per unit of uncertainty fall, and analyst reports are more frequent and longer. The increased impact of analysts is also more pronounced for harder-to-value firms. These results are consistent with analysts working harder and investors relying more on analysts in bad times."
"The Fed, the Bond Market, and Gradualism in Monetary Policy",JEREMY C. STEIN,12 February 2018,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12614,"ABSTRACTWe develop a model of monetary policy with two key features: the central bank has private information about its long-run target rate and is averse to bond market volatility. In this setting, the central bank gradually impounds changes in its target into the policy rate. Such gradualism represents an attempt to not spook the bond market. However, this effort is partially undone in equilibrium, as markets rationally react more to a given move when the central bank moves more gradually. This time-consistency problem means that society would be better off if the central bank cared less about the bond market."
Higher Order Effects in Asset Pricing Models with Long-Run Risks,WALTER POHL,02 February 2018,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12615,"ABSTRACTThis paper shows that the latest generation of asset pricing models with long-run risk exhibit economically significant nonlinearities, and thus the ubiquitous Campbell-Shiller log-linearization can generate large numerical errors. These errors translate in turn to considerable errors in the model predictions, for example, for the magnitude of the equity premium or return predictability. We demonstrate that these nonlinearities arise from the presence of multiple highly persistent processes, which cause the exogenous states to attain values far away from their long-run means with nonnegligible probability. These extreme values have a significant impact on asset price dynamics."
What Makes a Good Trader? On the Role of Intuition and Reflection on Trader Performance,BRICE CORGNET,16 February 2018,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12619,"ABSTRACTUsing laboratory experiments, we provide evidence on three factors influencing trader performance: fluid intelligence, cognitive reflection, and theory of mind (ToM). Fluid intelligence provides traders with computational skills necessary to draw a statistical inference. Cognitive reflection helps traders avoid behavioral biases and thereby extract signals from market orders and update their prior beliefs accordingly. ToM describes the degree to which traders correctly assess the informational content of orders. We show that cognitive reflection and ToM are complementary because traders benefit from understanding signals’ quality only if they are capable of processing these signals."
How Do Financing Constraints Affect Firms’ Equity Volatility?,DANIEL CARVALHO,05 February 2018,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12610,ABSTRACTTheory suggests that financing frictions can have significant implications for equity volatility by shaping firms’ exposure to economic risks. This paper provides evidence that an important determinant of higher equity volatility among research and development (R&D)-intensive firms is fewer financing constraints on firms’ ability to access growth options. I provide evidence for this effect by studying how persistent shocks to the value of firms’ tangible assets (real estate) affect their subsequent equity volatility. The analysis addresses concerns about the identification of these balance sheet effects and shows that these effects are consistent with broader patterns on the equity volatility of R&D-intensive firms.
Interpreting Factor Models,SERHIY KOZAK,02 February 2018,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12612,"ABSTRACTWe argue that tests of reduced-form factor models and horse races between “characteristics” and “covariances” cannot discriminate between alternative models of investor beliefs. Since asset returns have substantial commonality, absence of near-arbitrage opportunities implies that the stochastic discount factor can be represented as a function of a few dominant sources of return variation. As long as some arbitrageurs are present, this conclusion applies even in an economy in which all cross-sectional variation in expected returns is caused by sentiment. Sentiment-investor demand results in substantial mispricing only if arbitrageurs are exposed to factor risk when taking the other side of these trades."
Belief Dispersion in the Stock Market,ADEM ATMAZ,16 February 2018,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12618,"ABSTRACTWe develop a dynamic model of belief dispersion with a continuum of investors differing in beliefs. The model is tractable and qualitatively matches many of the empirical regularities in a stock price and its mean return, volatility, and trading volume. We find that the stock price is convex in cash-flow news and increases in belief dispersion, while its mean return decreases when the view on the stock is optimistic, and vice versa when pessimistic. Moreover, belief dispersion leads to higher stock volatility and trading volume. We demonstrate that otherwise identical two-investor heterogeneous-beliefs economies do not necessarily generate our main results."
Margin Requirements and the Security Market Line,PETRI JYLHÄ,18 February 2018,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12616,"ABSTRACTBetween 1934 and 1974, the Federal Reserve changed the initial margin requirement for the U.S. stock market 22 times. I use this variation to show that investors' leverage constraints affect the pricing of risk. Consistent with earlier theoretical predictions, I find that tighter leverage constraints result in a flatter relation between betas and expected returns. My results provide strong empirical support for the idea that the constraints investors face may help explain the empirical failure of the capital asset pricing model."
Is Proprietary Trading Detrimental to Retail Investors?,FALKO FECHT,02 February 2018,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12609,"ABSTRACTWe study the conflict of interest that arises when a universal bank conducts proprietary trading alongside its retail banking services. Our data set contains the stock holdings of every German bank and those of their corresponding retail clients. We investigate (i) whether banks sell stocks from their proprietary portfolios to their retail customers, (ii) whether those stocks subsequently underperform, and (iii) whether retail customers of banks engaging in proprietary trading earn lower portfolio returns than their peers. We present affirmative evidence for all three questions and conclude that proprietary trading can, in fact, be detrimental to retail investors."
"Real Options Models of the Firm, Capacity Overhang, and the Cross Section of Stock Returns",KEVIN ARETZ,17 February 2018,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12617,"ABSTRACTWe use a stochastic frontier model to obtain a stock-level estimate of the difference between a firm's installed production capacity and its optimal capacity. We show that this “capacity overhang” estimate relates significantly negatively to the cross section of stock returns, even when controlling for popular pricing factors. The negative relation persists among small and large stocks, stocks with more or less reversible investments, and in good and bad economic states. Capacity overhang helps explain momentum and profitability anomalies, but not value and investment anomalies. Our evidence supports real options models of the firm featuring valuable divestment options."
Is Fraud Contagious? Coworker Influence on Misconduct by Financial Advisors,STEPHEN G. DIMMOCK,02 February 2018,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12613,"ABSTRACTUsing a novel data set of U.S. financial advisors that includes individuals' employment histories and misconduct records, we show that coworkers influence an individual's propensity to commit financial misconduct. We identify coworkers' effect on misconduct using changes in coworkers caused by mergers of financial advisory firms. The tests include merger-firm fixed effects to exploit the variation in changes to coworkers across branches of the same firm. The probability of an advisor committing misconduct increases if his new coworkers, encountered in the merger, have a history of misconduct. This effect is stronger between demographically similar coworkers."
Unshrouding: Evidence from Bank Overdrafts in Turkey,SULE ALAN,12 October 2017,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12593,"ABSTRACTLower prices produce higher demand… or do they? A bank's direct marketing to holders of “free” checking accounts shows that a large discount on 60% APR overdraftsreducesoverdraft usage, especially when bundled with a discount on debit card or autodebit transactions. In contrast, messages mentioning overdraft availability without mentioning priceincreaseusage. Neither change persists long after the messages stop. These results do not square easily with classical models of consumer choice and firm competition. Instead, they support behavioral models where consumers underestimate and are inattentive to overdraft costs, and firms respond by shrouding overdraft prices in equilibrium."
Homeowner Borrowing and Housing Collateral: New Evidence from Expiring Price Controls,ANTHONY A. DEFUSCO,18 December 2017,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12602,"ABSTRACTI empirically analyze how changes in access to housing collateral affect homeowner borrowing behavior. To isolate the role of collateral constraints from that of wealth effects, I exploit the fully anticipated expiration of resale price controls on owner-occupied housing in Montgomery County, Maryland. I estimate a marginal propensity to borrow out of housing collateral that ranges between $0.04 and $0.13 and is correlated with homeowners' initial leverage. Additional analysis of residential investment and ex-post loan performance indicates that some of the extracted funds generated new expenditures. These results suggest a potentially important role for collateral constraints in driving household expenditures."
Wholesale Funding Dry-Ups,CHRISTOPHE PÉRIGNON,10 October 2017,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12592,"ABSTRACTWe empirically explore the fragility of wholesale funding of banks, using transaction-level data on short-term, unsecured certificates of deposit in the European market. We do not observe a market-wide freeze during the 2008 to 2014 period. Yet, many banks suddenly experience funding dry-ups. Dry-ups predict, but do not cause, future deterioration in bank performance. Furthermore, during periods of market stress, banks with high future performance tend to increase reliance on wholesale funding. We therefore fail to find evidence consistent with adverse selection models of funding market freezes. Our evidence is in line with theories highlighting heterogeneity between informed and uninformed lenders."
Liquidity as Social Expertise,PABLO KURLAT,22 December 2017,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12606,"ABSTRACTThis paper proposes a theory of liquidity dynamics. Illiquidity results from asymmetric information. Observing the historical track record teaches agents how to interpret public information and helps overcome information asymmetry. However, an illiquidity trap can arise: too much asymmetric information leads to the breakdown of trade, which interrupts learning and perpetuates illiquidity. Liquidity falls in response to unexpected events that lead agents to question their valuation models (especially in newer markets) may be slow to recover after a crisis, and is higher in periods of stability."
Institutional and Legal Context in Natural Experiments: The Case of State Antitakeover Laws,JONATHAN M. KARPOFF,15 December 2017,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12600,"ABSTRACTWe argue and demonstrate empirically that a firm's institutional and legal context has first-order effects in tests that use state antitakeover laws for identification. A priori, the size and direction of a law's effect on a firm's takeover protection depends on (i) other state antitakeover laws, (ii) preexisting firm-level takeover defenses, and (iii) the legal regime as reflected by important court decisions. In addition, (iv) state antitakeover laws are not exogenous for many easily identifiable firms. We show that the inferences from nine prior studies related to nine different outcome variables change substantially when we include controls for these considerations."
Comparing Asset Pricing Models,FRANCISCO BARILLAS,08 February 2018,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12607,"ABSTRACTA Bayesian asset pricing test is derived that is easily computed in closed form from the standardF-statistic. Given a set of candidate traded factors, we develop a related test procedure that permits the computation of model probabilities for the collection of all possible pricing models that are based on subsets of the given factors. We find that the recent models of Hou, Xue, and Zhang (2015a, 2015b) and Fama and French (2015, 2016) are dominated by a variety of models that include a momentum factor, along with value and profitability factors that are updated monthly."
Short-Selling Risk,JOSEPH E. ENGELBERG,15 December 2017,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12601,"ABSTRACTShort sellers face unique risks, such as the risk that stock loans become expensive and the risk that stock loans are recalled. We show that short-selling risk affects prices among the cross-section of stocks. Stocks with more short-selling risk have lower returns, less price efficiency, and less short selling."
Bank Capital and Lending Relationships,MICHAEL SCHWERT,18 December 2017,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12604,"ABSTRACTThis paper investigates the mechanisms behind the matching of banks and firms in the loan market and the implications of this matching for lending relationships, bank capital, and credit provision. I find that bank-dependent firms borrow from well-capitalized banks, while firms with access to the bond market borrow from banks with less capital. This matching of bank-dependent firms with stable banks smooths cyclicality in aggregate credit provision and mitigates the effects of bank shocks on the real economy."
Financial Literacy and Portfolio Dynamics,MILO BIANCHI,16 December 2017,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12605,"ABSTRACTWe match administrative panel data on portfolio choices with survey measures of financial literacy. When we control for portfolio risk, the most literate households experience 0.4% higher annual returns than the least literate households. Distinct portfolio dynamics are the key determinant of this difference. More literate households hold riskier positions when expected returns are higher, they more actively rebalance their portfolios and do so in a way that holds their risk exposure relatively constant over time, and they are more likely to buy assets that provide higher returns than the assets that they sell."
Option Mispricing around Nontrading Periods,CHRISTOPHER S. JONES,16 December 2017,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12603,"ABSTRACTWe find that option returns are significantly lower over nontrading periods, the vast majority of which are weekends. Our evidence suggests that nontrading returns cannot be explained by risk, but rather are the result of widespread and highly persistent option mispricing driven by the incorrect treatment of stock return variance during periods of market closure. The size of the effect implies that the broad spectrum of finance research involving option prices should account for nontrading effects. Our study further suggests how alternative industry practices could improve the efficiency of option markets in a meaningful way."
Personal Lending Relationships,STEPHEN ADAM KAROLYI,23 October 2017,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12589,"ABSTRACTI identify the effects of personal relationships on loan contracting using executive deaths and retirements at other firms as a source of exogenous variation in executive turnover. After plausibly exogenous turnover, borrowers choose lenders with which their new executives have personal relationships 4.1 times as frequently, and loans from these lenders have 20 basis points lower spreads and 12.5% larger amounts. Personal relationships benefit firms across loan terms, especially during macroeconomic downturns. Increased financial flexibility from personal relationships insulated firms from financial shocks during the recent financial crisis: they exhibited less constrained investment and were less likely to layoff employees."
Measuring Liquidity Mismatch in the Banking Sector,JENNIE BAI,10 October 2017,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12591,"ABSTRACTThis paper constructs a liquidity mismatch index (LMI) to gauge the mismatch between the market liquidity of assets and the funding liquidity of liabilities, for 2,882 bank holding companies over 2002 to 2014. The aggregate LMI decreases from +$4 trillion precrisis to −$6 trillion in 2008. We conduct an LMI stress test revealing the fragility of the banking system in early 2007. Moreover, LMI predicts a bank's stock market crash probability and borrowing decisions from the government during the financial crisis. The LMI is therefore informative about both individual bank liquidity and the liquidity risk of the entire banking system."
Optimal Debt and Profitability in the Trade-Off Theory,ANDREW B. ABEL,10 October 2017,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12590,"ABSTRACTI develop a dynamic model of leverage with tax deductible interest and an endogenous cost of default. The interest rate includes a premium to compensate lenders for expected losses in default. A borrowing constraint is generated by lenders' unwillingness to lend an amount that would trigger immediate default. When the borrowing constraint is not binding, the trade-off theory of debt holds: optimal debt equates the marginal interest tax shield and the marginal expected cost of default. Contrary to conventional interpretation, but consistent with empirical findings, increases in current or future profitability reduce the optimal leverage ratio when the trade-off theory holds."
The Leverage Ratchet Effect,ANAT R. ADMATI,10 October 2017,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12588,"ABSTRACTFirms’ inability to commit to future funding choices has profound consequences for capital structure dynamics. With debt in place, shareholders pervasively resist leverage reductions no matter how much such reductions may enhance firm value. Shareholders would instead choose to increase leverage even if the new debt is junior and would reduce firm value. These asymmetric forces in leverage adjustments, which we call theleverage ratchet effect, cause equilibrium leverage outcomes to be history-dependent. If forced to reduce leverage, shareholders are biased toward selling assets relative to potentially more efficient alternatives such as pure recapitalizations."
Diagnostic Expectations and Credit Cycles,PEDRO BORDALO,26 September 2017,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12586,"ABSTRACTWe present a model of credit cycles arising from diagnostic expectations—a belief formation mechanism based on Kahneman and Tversky's representativeness heuristic. Diagnostic expectations overweight future outcomes that become more likely in light of incoming data. The expectations formation rule is forward looking and depends on the underlying stochastic process, and thus is immune to the Lucas critique. Diagnostic expectations reconcile extrapolation and neglect of risk in a unified framework. In our model, credit spreads are excessively volatile, overreact to news, and are subject to predictable reversals. These dynamics can account for several features of credit cycles and macroeconomic volatility."
The Paradox of Financial Fire Sales: The Role of Arbitrage Capital in Determining Liquidity,JAMES DOW,03 October 2017,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12584,"ABSTRACTHow can fire sales for financial assets happen when the economy contains well-capitalized but nonspecialist investors? Our explanation combines rational expectations equilibrium and “lemons” models. When specialist (informed) market participants are liquidity-constrained, prices become less informative. This creates an adverse selection problem, decreasing the supply of high-quality assets, and lowering valuations by nonspecialist (uninformed) investors, who become unwilling to supply capital to support the price. In normal times, arbitrage capital can “multiply” itself by making uninformed capital function as informed capital, but in a crisis, this stabilizing mechanism fails."
"Government Credit, a Double-Edged Sword: Evidence from the China Development Bank",HONG RU,26 September 2017,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12585,"ABSTRACTUsing proprietary data from the China Development Bank (CDB), this paper examines the effects of government credit on firm activities. Tracing the effects of government credit across different levels of the supply chain, I find that CDB industrial loans to state-owned enterprises (SOEs) crowd out private firms in the same industry but crowd in private firms in downstream industries. On average, a $1 increase in CDB SOE loans leads to a $0.20 decrease in private firms' assets. Moreover, CDB infrastructure loans crowd in private firms. I use exogenous timing of municipal politicians' turnover as an instrument for CDB credit flows."
A Model of Monetary Policy and Risk Premia,ITAMAR DRECHSLER,22 June 2017,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12539,"ABSTRACTWe develop a dynamic asset pricing model in which monetary policy affects the risk premium component of the cost of capital. Risk-tolerant agents (banks) borrow from risk-averse agents (i.e., take deposits) to fund levered investments. Leverage exposes banks to funding risk, which they insure by holding liquidity buffers. By changing the nominal rate the central bank influences the liquidity premium, and hence the cost of taking leverage. Lower nominal rates make liquidity cheaper and raise leverage, resulting in lower risk premia and higher asset prices, volatility, investment, and growth. We analyze forward guidance, a “Greenspan put,” and the yield curve."
The Share of Systematic Variation in Bilateral Exchange Rates,ADRIEN VERDELHAN,09 October 2017,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12587,ABSTRACTSorting countries by their dollar currency betas produces a novel cross section of average currency excess returns. A slope factor (long in high beta currencies and short in low beta currencies) accounts for this cross section of currency risk premia. This slope factor is orthogonal to the high-minus-low carry trade factor built from portfolios of countries sorted by their interest rates. The two high-minus-low risk factors account for 18% to 80% of the monthly exchange rate movements. The two risk factors suggest that stochastic discount factors in complete markets' models should feature at least two global shocks to describe exchange rates.
"Agency, Firm Growth, and Managerial Turnover",RONALD W. ANDERSON,25 September 2017,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12583,"ABSTRACTWe study managerial incentive provision under moral hazard when growth opportunities arrive stochastically and pursuing them requires a change in management. A trade-off arises between the benefit of always having the “right” manager and the cost of incentive provision. The prospect of growth-induced turnover limits the firm's ability to rely on deferred pay, resulting in more front-loaded compensation. The optimal contract may insulate managers from the risk of growth-induced dismissal after periods of good performance. The evidence for the United States broadly supports the model's predictions: Firms with better growth prospects experience higher CEO turnover and use more front-loaded compensation."

Brokers and Order Flow Leakage: Evidence from Fire Sales,ANDREA BARBON,09 August 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12840,"ABSTRACTUsing trade-level data, we study whether brokers play a role in spreading order flow information in the stock market. We focus on large portfolio liquidations that result in temporary price drops, and identify the brokers who intermediate these trades. These brokers’ clients are more likely to predate on the liquidating funds than to provide liquidity. Predation leads to profits of about 25 basis points over 10 days and increases the liquidation costs of the distressed fund by 40%. This evidence suggests a role of information leakage in exacerbating fire sales."
Information Revelation in Decentralized Markets,BJÖRN HAGSTRÖMER,09 August 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12838,"ABSTRACTHow does information get revealed in decentralized markets? We test several hypotheses inspired by recent dealer-network theory. To do so, we construct an empirical map of information revelation where two dealers are connected based on the synchronicity of their quote changes. The tests, based on the euro to Swiss franc spot rate (EUR/CHF) quote data including the 2015 crash, largely support theory: strongly connected (i.e., central) dealers are more informed. Connections are weaker when there is less to be learned. The crash serves to identify how a network forms when dealers are transitioned from no-learning to learning, that is, from a fixed to a floating rate."
Do Investors Value Sustainability? A Natural Experiment Examining Ranking and Fund Flows,SAMUEL M. HARTZMARK,09 August 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12841,"ABSTRACTExamining a shock to the salience of the sustainability of the U.S. mutual fund market, we present causal evidence that investors marketwide value sustainability: being categorized as low sustainability resulted in net outflows of more than $12 billion while being categorized as high sustainability led to net inflows of more than $24 billion. Experimental evidence suggests that sustainability is viewed as positively predicting future performance, but we do not find evidence that high-sustainability funds outperform low-sustainability funds. The evidence is consistent with positive affect influencing expectations of sustainable fund performance and nonpecuniary motives influencing investment decisions."
Diagnostic Expectations and Stock Returns,PEDRO BORDALO,06 July 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12833,"ABSTRACTWe revisit La Porta's finding that returns on stocks with the most optimistic analyst long-term earnings growth forecasts are lower than those on stocks with the most pessimistic forecasts. We document the joint dynamics of fundamentals, expectations, and returns of these portfolios, and explain the facts using a model of belief formation based on the representativeness heuristic. Analysts forecast fundamentals from observed earnings growth, but overreact to news by exaggerating the probability of states that have become more likely. We find support for the model's predictions. A quantitative estimation of the model accounts for the key patterns in the data."
Funding Liquidity without Banks: Evidence from a Shock to the Cost of Very Short-Term Debt,FELIPE RESTREPO,06 July 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12832,"ABSTRACTIn 2011, Colombia instituted a tax on repayment of bank loans, which increased the cost of short-term bank credit more than long-term credit. Firms responded by cutting short-term loans for liquidity management purposes and increasing the use of cash and trade credit. In industries in which trade credit is more accessible (based on U.S. Compustat firms), we find substitution into accounts payable and little effect on cash and investment. Where trade credit is less available, firms increase cash and cut investment. Thus, trade credit provides an alternative source of liquidity that can insulate some firms from bank liquidity shocks."
Women's Liberation as a Financial Innovation,MOSHE HAZAN,29 June 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12829,"ABSTRACTIn one of the greatest extensions of property rights in human history, common law countries began giving rights to married women in the 1850s. Before this “women's liberation,” the doctrine of coverture strongly incentivized parents of daughters to hold real estate, rather than financial assets such as money, stocks, or bonds. We exploit the staggered nature of coverture's demise across U.S. states to show that women's rights led to shifts in household portfolios, a positive shock to the supply of credit, and a reallocation of labor toward nonagriculture and capital-intensive industries. Investor protection thus deepened financial markets, aiding industrialization."
YOLO: Mortality Beliefs and Household Finance Puzzles,RAWLEY Z. HEIMER,29 June 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12828,"ABSTRACTWe study the effect of subjective mortality beliefs on life-cycle behavior. With new survey evidence, we document that survival is underestimated (overestimated) by the young (old). We calibrate a canonical life-cycle model to elicited beliefs. Relative to calibrations using actuarial probabilities, the young undersave by 26%, and retirees draw down their assets 27% slower, while the model's fit to consumption data improves by 88%. Cross-sectional regressions support the model's predictions: Distorted mortality beliefs correlate with savings behavior while controlling for risk preferences, cognitive, and socioeconomic factors. Overweighting the likelihood of rare events contributes to mortality belief distortions."
Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets,MARKUS GLASER,08 August 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12835,"ABSTRACTPrices and returns are alternative ways to present information and to elicit expectations in financial markets. But do investors think of prices and returns in the same way? We present three studies in which subjects differ in the level of expertise, amount of information, and type of incentive scheme. The results are consistent across all studies: asking subjects to forecast returns as opposed to prices results in higher expectations, whereas showing them return charts rather than price charts results in lower expectations. Experience is not a useful remedy but cognitive reflection mitigates the impact of format changes."
Nonfinancial Firms as Cross-Market Arbitrageurs,YUERAN MA,09 August 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12837,"ABSTRACTI demonstrate that nonfinancial corporations act as cross-market arbitrageurs in their own securities. Firms use one type of security to replace another in response to shifts in relative valuations, inducing negatively correlated financing flows in different markets. Net equity repurchases and net debt issuance both increase when expected excess returns on debt are particularly low, or when expected excess returns on equity are relatively high. Credit valuations affect equity financing as much as equity valuations do, and vice versa. Cross-market corporate arbitrage is most prevalent among large, unconstrained firms, and helps account for aggregate financing patterns."
Measuring Institutional Investors’ Skill at Making Private Equity Investments,DANIEL R. CAVAGNARO,06 May 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12783,"ABSTRACTUsing a large sample of institutional investors’ investments in private equity funds raised between 1991 and 2011, we estimate the extent to which investors’ skill affects their returns. Bootstrap analyses show that the variance of actual performance is higher than would be expected by chance, suggesting that some investors consistently outperform. Extending the Bayesian approach of Korteweg and Sorensen, we estimate that a one-standard-deviation increase in skill leads to an increase in annual returns of between one and two percentage points. These results are stronger in the earlier part of the sample period and for venture funds."
Where Is the Risk in Value? Evidence from a Market-to-Book Decomposition,ANDREY GOLUBOV,09 August 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12836,"ABSTRACTWe study the value premium using the multiples-based market-to-book decomposition of Rhodes-Kropf, Robinson, and Viswanathan (2005). The market-to-value component drivesallof the value strategy return, while the value-to-book component exhibits no return predictability in either portfolio sorts or firm-level regressions. Existing results linking market-to-book to operating leverage, duration, exposure to investment-specific technology shocks, and analysts’ risk ratings derive from the unpriced value-to-book component. In contrast, results on expectation errors, limits to arbitrage, and certain types of cash flow risk and consumption risk exposure are due to the market-to-value component. Overall, our evidence casts doubt on several value premium theories."
A Dynamic Model of Characteristic-Based Return Predictability,AYDOĞAN ALTI,08 August 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12839,"ABSTRACTWe present a dynamic model that links characteristic-based return predictability to systematic factors that determine the evolution of firm fundamentals. In the model, an economy-wide disruption process reallocates profits from existing businesses to new projects and thus generates a source of systematic risk for portfolios of firms sorted on value, profitability, and asset growth. If investors are overconfident about their ability to evaluate the disruption climate, these characteristic-sorted portfolios exhibit persistent mispricing. The model generates predictions about the conditional predictability of characteristic-sorted portfolio returns and illustrates how return persistence increases the likelihood of observing characteristic-based anomalies."
Over-the-Counter Market Frictions and Yield Spread Changes,NILS FRIEWALD,30 June 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12827,"ABSTRACTWe empirically study whether systematic over-the-counter (OTC) market frictions drive the large unexplained common factor in yield spread changes. Using transaction data on U.S. corporate bonds, we find that marketwide inventory, search, and bargaining frictions explain 23.4% of the variation in the common component. Systematic OTC frictions thus substantially improve the explanatory power of yield spread changes and account for one-third of their total explained variation. Search and bargaining frictions combined explain more in the common dynamics of yield spread changes than inventory frictions. Our findings support the implications of leading theories of intermediation frictions in OTC markets."

The Dividend Disconnect,SAMUEL M. HARTZMARK,13 May 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12785,"ABSTRACTMany individual investors, mutual funds, and institutions trade as if dividends and capital gains are disconnected attributes, not fully appreciating that dividends result in price decreases. Behavioral trading patterns (e.g., the disposition effect) are driven by price changes instead of total returns. Investors rarely reinvest dividends, and trade as if dividends are a separate, stable income stream. Analysts fail to account for the effect of dividends on price, leading to optimistic price forecasts for dividend-paying stocks. Demand for dividends is systematically higher in periods of low interest rates and poor market performance, leading to lower returns for dividend-paying stocks."
Stock Returns over the FOMC Cycle,ANNA CIESLAK,31 May 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12818,"ABSTRACTWe document that since 1994, the equity premium is earned entirely in weeks 0, 2, 4, and 6 in Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) cycle time, that is, even weeks starting from the last FOMC meeting. We causally tie this fact to the Fed by studying intermeeting target changes, Fed funds futures, and internal Board of Governors meetings. The Fed has affected the stock market via unexpectedly accommodating policy, leading to large reductions in the equity premium. Evidence suggests systematic informal communication of Fed officials with the media and financial sector as a channel through which news about monetary policy has reached the market."
Foreclosure Contagion and the Neighborhood Spillover Effects of Mortgage Defaults,ARPIT GUPTA,31 May 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12821,"ABSTRACTIn this paper, I identify shocks to interest rates resulting from two administrative details in adjustable-rate mortgage contract terms: the choice of financial index and the choice of lookback period. I find that a 1 percentage point increase in interest rate at the time of adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) reset results in a 2.5 percentage increase in the probability of foreclosure in the following year, and that each foreclosure filing leads to an additional 0.3 to 0.6 completed foreclosures within a 0.10-mile radius. In explaining this result, I emphasize price effects, bank-supply responses, and borrower responses arising from peer effects."
Limited Investment Capital and Credit Spreads,EMIL N. SIRIWARDANE,18 April 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12777,"ABSTRACTUsing proprietary credit default swap (CDS) data, I investigate how capital shocks at protection sellers impact pricing in the CDS market. Seller capital shocks—measured as CDS portfolio margin payments—account for 12% of the time-series variation in weekly spread changes, a significant amount given that standard credit factors account for 18% during my sample. In addition, seller shocks possess information for spreads that is independent of institution-wide measures of constraints. These findings imply a high degree of market segmentation, and suggest that frictions within specialized financial institutions prevent capital from flowing into the market at shorter horizons."
How Do Investment Ideas Spread through Social Interaction? Evidence from a Ponzi Scheme,VILLE RANTALA,31 May 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12822,"ABSTRACTA unique data set from a large Ponzi scheme allows me to study word-of-mouth diffusion of investment information. Investors could join the scheme only by invitation from an existing member, which allows me to observe how the idea spreads from one person to the next based on inviter-invitee relationships. I find that the observed social network has a scale-free connectivity structure, which significantly facilitates the diffusion of the investment idea and contributes to the growth and survival of the socially spreading Ponzi scheme. I further find that investors invest more if their inviter has comparatively higher age, education, and income."
The Globalization Risk Premium,JEAN-NOËL BARROT,18 April 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12780,"ABSTRACTIn this paper, we investigate how globalization is reflected in asset prices. We use shipping costs to measure firms' exposure to globalization. Firms in low shipping cost industries carry a 7% risk premium, suggesting that their cash flows covary negatively with investors' marginal utility. We find that the premium emanates from the risk of displacement of least efficient firms triggered by import competition. These findings suggest that foreign productivity shocks are associated with times when consumption is dear for investors. We discuss conditions under which a standard model of trade with asset prices can rationalize this puzzle."
Proxy Advisory Firms: The Economics of Selling Information to Voters,ANDREY MALENKO,17 April 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12779,"ABSTRACTWe analyze how proxy advisors, which sell voting recommendations to shareholders, affect corporate decision-making. If the quality of the advisor's information is low, there is overreliance on its recommendations and insufficient private information production. In contrast, if the advisor's information is precise, it may be underused because the advisor rations its recommendations to maximize profits. Overall, the advisor's presence leads to more informative voting only if its information is sufficiently precise. We evaluate several proposals on regulating proxy advisors and show that some suggested policies, such as reducing proxy advisors' market power or decreasing litigation pressure, can have negative effects."
Personal Experiences and Expectations about Aggregate Outcomes,THERESA KUCHLER,03 June 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12819,"ABSTRACTUsing novel survey data, we document that individuals extrapolate from recent personal experiences when forming expectations about aggregate economic outcomes. Recent locally experienced house price movements affect expectations about future U.S. house price changes and higher experienced house price volatility causes respondents to report a wider distribution over expected U.S. house price movements. When we exploit within-individual variation in employment status, we find that individuals who personally experience unemployment become more pessimistic about future nationwide unemployment. The extent of extrapolation is unrelated to how informative personal experiences are, is inconsistent with risk adjustment, and is more pronounced for less sophisticated individuals."
Do Portfolio Manager Contracts Contract Portfolio Management?,JUNG HOON LEE,13 June 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12823,"ABSTRACTMost mutual fund managers have performance-based contracts. Our theory predicts that mutual fund managers with asymmetric contracts and mid-year performance close to their announced benchmark increase their portfolio risk in the second part of the year. As predicted by our theory, performance deviation from the benchmark decreases risk-shifting only for managers with performance contracts. Deviation from the benchmark dominates incentives from the flow-performance relation, suggesting that risk-shifting is motivated more by management contracts than by a tournament to capture flows."
The Best of Both Worlds: Accessing Emerging Economies via Developed Markets,JOON WOO BAE,01 June 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12817,"ABSTRACTA growing body of evidence suggests that the benefits of international diversification via developed markets have declined dramatically. While emerging markets still offer diversification opportunities, their public equity indices capture only a fraction of emerging countries' economic activity. We propose a diversification approach that exploits the global connectedness of developed countries to gain exposure to emerging countries' overall economies rather than their shallow equity markets. In doing so, we demonstrate that developed marketsstilloffer substantial diversification benefits beyond those available through equity indices. Our results suggest that relying on equity indices to assess diversification benefits understates diversification gains."
Ratings Quality and Borrowing Choice,DOMINIQUE C. BADOER,31 May 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12820,"ABSTRACTPast studies document that incentive conflicts may lead issuer-paid credit rating agencies to provide optimistically biased ratings. In this paper, we present evidence that investors question the quality of issuer-paid ratings and raise corporate bond yields where the issuer-paid rating is more positive than benchmark investor-paid ratings. We also find that some firms with favorable issuer-paid ratings substitute public bonds with borrowings from informed intermediaries to mitigate the “lemons discount” associated with poor quality ratings. Overall, our results suggest that the quality of issuer-paid ratings has significant effects on borrowing costs and the choice of debt."
"Reassessing False Discoveries in Mutual Fund Performance: Skill, Luck, or Lack of Power?",ANGIE ANDRIKOGIANNOPOULOU,07 May 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12784,"ABSTRACTBarras, Scaillet, and Wermers propose the false discovery rate (FDR) to separate skill (alpha) from luck in fund performance. Using simulations with parameters informed by the data, we find that this methodology is conservative and underestimates the proportion of nonzero-alpha funds. For example, 65% of funds with economically large alphas of±2%are misclassified as zero alpha. This bias arises from the low signal-to-noise ratio in fund returns and the resulting low statistical power. Our results question FDR's applicability in performance evaluation and other domains with low power, and can materially change the conclusion that most funds have zero alpha."
A Note on “Risk Reduction in Large Portfolios: Why Imposing the Wrong Constraints Helps”,RAVI JAGANNATHAN,02 July 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12824,"ABSTRACTThis note corrects an error in the proof of Proposition 2 of “Risk Reduction in Large Portfolios: Why Imposing the Wrong Constraint Helps” that appeared in theJournal of Finance, August 2003."
Presidential Address: Collateral and Commitment,PETER M. DEMARZO,15 July 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12782,"ABSTRACTOptimal dynamic capital structure choice is fundamentally a problem of commitment. In a standard trade-off setting with shareholder-debtholder agency conflicts, full commitment counterfactually predicts the firm would rely almost exclusively on debt financing. Conversely, absent commitment a Modigliani-Miller-like value irrelevance and policy indeterminacy result holds. Thus, the content of dynamic trade-off theory must depend on the commitment technology. In this context, collateral is valuable as a low-cost commitment device. Because ex ante optimal commitments are likely to be suboptimal ex post, observed capital structure dynamics will exhibit hysteresis and depart significantly from standard predictions."
Price Discovery without Trading: Evidence from Limit Orders,JONATHAN BROGAARD,18 March 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12769,"ABSTRACTWe analyze
 the contribution to price discovery of market and limit orders by high-frequency traders (HFTs) and non-HFTs. While market orders have a larger individual price impact, limit orders are far more numerous. This results in price discovery occurring predominantly through limit orders. HFTs submit the bulk of limit orders and these limit orders provide most of the price discovery. Submissions of limit orders and their contribution to price discovery fall with volatility due to changes in HFTs’ behavior. Consistent with adverse selection arising from faster reactions to public information, HFTs’ informational advantage is partially explained by public information."
Real Anomalies,JULES H. van BINSBERGEN,18 March 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12771,"ABSTRACTWe examine the importance of cross-sectional asset pricing anomalies (alphas) for the real economy. To this end, we develop a novel quantitative model of the cross-section of firms that features lumpy investment and informational inefficiencies, while yielding distributions in closed form. Our findings indicate that anomalies can cause material real inefficiencies, which raises the possibility that agents who help eliminate them add significant value to the economy. The model shows that the magnitude of alphas alone is a poor indicator of real outcomes, and highlights the importance of the alpha persistence, the amount of mispriced capital, and the Tobin'sqof firms affected."
Capital Share Dynamics When Firms Insure Workers,BARNEY HARTMAN-GLASER,30 March 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12773,"ABSTRACTAlthough the aggregate capital share of U.S. firms has increased, capital share at the firm-level has decreased. This divergence is due to mega-firms that produce a larger output share without a proportionate increase in labor compensation. We develop a model in which firms insure workers against firm-specific shocks, with more productive firms allocating more rents to shareholders, while less productive firms endogenously exit. Increasing firm-level risk delays exit and increases the measure of mega-firms, raising (lowering) the aggregate (average) capital share. An increase in the level of rents magnifies this effect. We present evidence that supports this mechanism."
Capital Share Risk in U.S. Asset Pricing,MARTIN LETTAU,30 March 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12772,"ABSTRACTA single macroeconomic factor based on growth in the capital share of aggregate income exhibits significant explanatory power for expected returns across a range of equity characteristic portfolios and nonequity asset classes, with risk price estimates that are of the same sign and similar in magnitude. Positive exposure to capital share risk earns a positive risk premium, commensurate with recent asset pricing models in which redistributive shocks shift the share of income between the wealthy, who finance consumption primarily out of asset ownership, and workers, who finance consumption primarily out of wages and salaries."
Labor-Technology Substitution: Implications for Asset Pricing,MIAO BEN ZHANG,26 February 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12766,"ABSTRACTThis paper studies the asset pricing implications of a firm's opportunities to replace routine-task labor with automation. I develop a model in which firms optimally undertake such replacement when their productivity is low. Hence, firms with routine-task labor maintain a replacement option that hedges their value against unfavorable macroeconomic shocks and lowers their expected returns. Using establishment-level occupational data, I construct a measure of firms' share of routine-task labor. Compared to their industry peers, firms with a higher share of routine-task labor (i) invest more in machines and reduce more routine-task labor during economic downturns, and (ii) have lower expected stock returns."
Time-Varying Asset Volatility and the Credit Spread Puzzle,DU DU,27 February 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12765,"ABSTRACTMost extant structural credit risk models underestimate credit spreads—a shortcoming known as the credit spread puzzle. We consider a model with priced stochastic asset risk that is able to fit medium- to long-term spreads. The model, augmented by jumps to help explain short-term spreads, is estimated on firm-level data and identifies significant asset variance risk premia. An important feature of the model is the significant time variation in risk premia induced by the uncertainty about asset risk. Various extensions are considered, among them optimal leverage and endogenous default."
What Is the Expected Return on a Stock?,IAN W. R. MARTIN,18 April 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12778,"ABSTRACTWe derive a formula for the expected return on a stock in terms of the risk-neutral variance of the market and the stock's excess risk-neutral variance relative to that of the average stock. These quantities can be computed from index and stock option prices; the formula has no free parameters. The theory performs well empirically both in and out of sample. Our results suggest that there is considerably more variation in expected returns, over time and across stocks, than has previously been acknowledged."
Nonlinearity and Flight-to-Safety in the Risk-Return Trade-Off for Stocks and Bonds,TOBIAS ADRIAN,17 April 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12776,"ABSTRACTWe document a highly significant, strongly nonlinear dependence of stock and bond returns on past equity market volatility as measured by the VIX. We propose a new estimator for the shape of the nonlinear forecasting relationship that exploits variation in the cross-section of returns. The nonlinearities are mirror images for stocks and bonds, revealing flight-to-safety: expected returns increase for stocks when volatility increases from moderate to high levels while they decline for Treasuries. These findings provide support for dynamic asset pricing theories in which the price of risk is a nonlinear function of market volatility."
"Costly Information Acquisition, Social Networks, and Asset Prices: Experimental Evidence",EDWARD HALIM,27 February 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12768,"ABSTRACTWe design an experiment to study the implications of information networks for incentives to acquire costly information, market liquidity, investors' earnings, and asset price characteristics in a financial market. Social communication crowds out information production as a result of an agent's temptation to free ride on the signals purchased by her neighbors. Although information exchange among traders increases trading volume, improves liquidity, and enhances the ability of asset prices to reflect the available information in the market, it fails to improve price informativeness. Net earnings and social welfare are higher with information sharing due to reduced acquisition of costly signals."
"CEO Horizon, Optimal Pay Duration, and the Escalation of Short-Termism",IVAN MARINOVIC,18 March 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12770,"ABSTRACTThis paper studies optimal contracts when managers manipulate their performance measure at the expense of firm value. Optimal contracts defer compensation. The manager's incentives vest over time at an increasing rate, and compensation becomes very sensitive to short-term performance. This generates an endogenous horizon problem whereby managers intensify performance manipulation in their final years in office. Contracts are designed to encourage effort while minimizing the adverse effects of manipulation. We characterize the optimal mix of short- and long-term compensation along the manager's tenure, the optimal vesting period of incentive pay, and the dynamics of short-termism over the CEO's tenure."
"Income Hedging, Dynamic Style Preferences, and Return Predictability",JAWAD M. ADDOUM,18 April 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12775,"ABSTRACTWe propose a theoretical measure of income hedging demand and show that it affects asset prices. We focus on the value factor and first demonstrate that our demand estimates are correlated with the actual demands of retail and mutual fund investors. We then show that the aggregate high-minus-low (HML) demand predicts HML returns. Exploiting the state-level variation in income risk, we demonstrate that state-level hedging demands predict state-level HML returns. A long-short portfolio that exploits this hedging-induced predictability earns an annualized risk-adjusted return of 6%."

High-Frequency Trading around Large Institutional Orders,VINCENT VAN KERVEL,14 February 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12759,"ABSTRACTLiquidity suppliers lean against the wind. We analyze whether high-frequency traders (HFTs) lean against large institutional orders that execute through a series of child orders. The alternative is HFTs trading with the wind, that is, in the same direction. We find that HFTs initially lean against these orders but eventually change direction and take positions in the same direction for the most informed institutional orders. Our empirical findings are consistent with investors trading strategically on their information. When deciding trade intensity, they seem to trade off higher speculative profits against higher risk of being detected and preyed on by HFTs."
Liquidity Risk and the Dynamics of Arbitrage Capital,PÉTER KONDOR,10 February 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12757,"ABSTRACTWe develop a continuous-time model of liquidity provision in which hedgers can trade multiple risky assets with arbitrageurs. Arbitrageurs have constant relative risk-aversion (CRRA) utility, while hedgers' asset demand is independent of wealth. An increase in hedgers' risk aversion can make arbitrageurs endogenously more risk-averse. Because arbitrageurs generate endogenous risk, an increase in their wealth or a reduction in their CRRA coefficient can raise risk premia despite Sharpe ratios declining. Arbitrageur wealth is a priced risk factor because assets held by arbitrageurs offer high expected returns but suffer the most when wealth drops. Aggregate illiquidity, which declines in wealth, captures that factor."
Employee Stock Option Exercise and Firm Cost,JENNIFER N. CARPENTER,16 December 2018,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12752,"ABSTRACTWe develop an empirical model of employee stock option exercise that is suitable for valuation and allows for behavioral channels. We estimate exercise rates as functions of option, stock, and employee characteristics using all employee exercises at 88 public firms, 27 of them in the S&P 500. Increasing vesting frequency from annual to monthly reduces option value by 11% to 16%. Men exercise faster, reducing value by 2% to 4%, while top employees exercise slower, increasing value by 2% to 7%. Finally, we develop an analytic valuation approximation that is more accurate than methods used in practice."
Brokers versus Retail Investors: Conflicting Interests and Dominated Products,MARK EGAN,20 February 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12763,"ABSTRACTI study how brokers distort household investment decisions. Using a novel convertible bond data set, I find that consumers often purchase dominated bonds—cheap and expensive otherwise-identical bonds coexist in the market. Brokers are incentivized to sell the dominated bonds, typically earning two times greater fees for selling them. I develop and estimate a broker-intermediated search model that rationalizes this behavior. The estimates indicate that costly search is a key friction in financial markets, but the effects of search costs are compounded when brokers are incentivized to direct the search of consumers toward high-fee inferior products."
Venture Capital and Capital Allocation,GIORGIA PIACENTINO,13 February 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12756,"ABSTRACTI show that venture capitalists' motivation to build reputation can have beneficial effects in the primary market, mitigating information frictions and helping firms go public. Because uninformed reputation-motivated venture capitalists want to appear informed, they are biased against backing firms—by not backing firms, they avoid taking low-value firms to market, which would ultimately reveal their lack of information. In equilibrium, reputation-motivated venture capitalists back relatively few bad firms, creating a certification effect that mitigates information frictions. However, they also back relatively few good firms, and thus, reputation motivation decreases welfare when good firms are abundant or profitable."
Trade Network Centrality and Currency Risk Premia,ROBERT J. RICHMOND,04 February 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12755,"ABSTRACTI uncover an economic source of exposure to global risk that drives international asset prices. Countries that are more central in the global trade network have lower interest rates and currency risk premia. To explain these findings, I present a general equilibrium model in which central countries' consumption growth is more exposed to global consumption growth shocks. This causes the currencies of central countries to appreciate in bad times, resulting in lower interest rates and currency risk premia. Empirically, central countries' consumption growth covaries more with world consumption growth, further validating the proposed mechanism."
"Optimal Contracting, Corporate Finance, and Valuation with Inalienable Human Capital",PATRICK BOLTON,20 February 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12761,"ABSTRACTA risk-averse entrepreneur with access to a profitable venture needs to raise funds from investors. She cannot indefinitely commit her human capital to the venture, which limits the firm's debt capacity, distorts investment and compensation, and constrains the entrepreneur's risk sharing. This puts dynamic liquidity and state-contingent risk allocation at the center of corporate financial management. The firm balances mean-variance investment efficiency and the preservation of financial slack. We show that in general the entrepreneur's net worth is overexposed to idiosyncratic risk and underexposed to systematic risk. These distortions are greater the closer the firm is to exhausting its debt capacity."
Leverage and the Cross-Section of Equity Returns,HITESH DOSHI,11 February 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12758,"ABSTRACTBuilding on theoretical asset pricing literature, we examine the role of market risk and the size, book-to-market (BTM), and volatility anomalies in the cross-section of unlevered equity returns. Compared with levered (stock) returns, unlevered market beta plays a more important role in explaining the cross-section of unlevered equity returns, even after controlling for size and BTM. The size effect is weakened, while the value premium and the volatility puzzle virtually disappear for unlevered returns. We show that leverage induces heteroskedasticity in returns. Unlevering returns removes this pattern, which is otherwise difficult to address by controlling for leverage in regressions."
Household Debt Overhang and Unemployment,JASON RODERICK DONALDSON,15 February 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12760,"ABSTRACTWe use a labor-search model to explain why the worst employment slumps often follow expansions of household debt. We find that households protected by limited liability suffer from a household-debt-overhang problem that leads them to require high wages to work. Firms respond by posting high wages but few vacancies. Thisvacancy posting effectimplies that high household debt leads to high unemployment. Even though households borrow from banks via bilaterally optimal contracts, the equilibrium level of household debt is inefficiently high due to ahousehold-debt externality. We analyze the role that a financial regulator can play in mitigating this externality."
"Financial Markets, the Real Economy, and Self-Fulfilling Uncertainties",JESS BENHABIB,17 February 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12764,"ABSTRACTWe develop a model of informational interdependence between financial markets and the real economy, linking economic uncertainty to information production and aggregate economic activities in general equilibrium. Themutuallearning between financial markets and the real economy creates a strategic complementarity in their information production, leading to self-fulfilling surges in economic uncertainties. In a dynamic setting, our model characterizes self-fulfilling uncertainty traps with two steady-state equilibria and a two-stage economic crisis in transitional dynamics."
On Equilibrium When Contingent Capital Has a Market Trigger: A Correction to Sundaresan and Wang Journal of Finance (2015),GEORGE PENNACCHI,18 February 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12762,"ABSTRACTThis paper identifies an error in Sundaresan and Wang (2015, hereafter SW) that invalidates its Theorem 1. The paper develops a model of contingent capital (CC) with a stock price trigger that is consistent with SW's framework and yields closed-form solutions for stock and CC prices. Yet, the model shows that unique stock price equilibria exist for a broader range of CC contractual terms than those required by SW. Specifically, when conversion terms benefit CC investors and penalize shareholders, a unique equilibrium can exist rather than the multiple equilibria stated in SW."
Political Connections and Allocative Distortions,DAVID SCHOENHERR,14 December 2018,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12751,"ABSTRACTExploiting a unique institutional setting in Korea, this paper documents that politicians can increase the amount of government resources allocated through their social networks to the benefit of private firms connected to these networks. After winning the election, the new president appoints members of his networks as CEOs of state-owned firms that act as intermediaries in allocating government contracts to private firms. In turn, these state firms allocate significantly more procurement contracts to private firms with a CEO from the same network. Contracts allocated to connected private firms are executed systematically worse and exhibit more frequent cost increases through renegotiations."
Portfolio Manager Compensation in the U.S. Mutual Fund Industry,LINLIN MA,12 December 2018,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12749,"ABSTRACTWe study compensation contracts of individual portfolio managers using hand-collected data of over 4,500 U.S. mutual funds. Variations in the compensation structures are broadly consistent with an optimal contracting equilibrium. The likelihood of explicit performance-based incentives is positively correlated with the intensity of agency conflicts, as proxied by the advisor's clientele dispersion, its affiliations in the financial industry, and its ownership structure. Investor sophistication and the threat of dismissal in outsourced funds serve as substitutes for explicit performance-based incentives. Finally, we find little evidence of differences in future performance associated with any particular compensation arrangement."
Sticky Expectations and the Profitability Anomaly,JEAN-PHILIPPE BOUCHAUD,07 October 2018,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12734,"ABSTRACTWe propose a theory of the “profitability” anomaly. In our model, investors forecast future profits using a signal and sticky belief dynamics. In this model, past profits forecast future returns (the profitability anomaly). Using analyst forecast data, we measure expectation stickiness at the firm level and find strong support for three additional model predictions: (1) analysts are on average too pessimistic regarding the future profits of high-profit firms, (2) the profitability anomaly is stronger for stocks that are followed by stickier analysts, and (3) the profitability anomaly is stronger for stocks with more persistent profits."
An Explanation of Negative Swap Spreads: Demand for Duration from Underfunded Pension Plans,SVEN KLINGLER,13 December 2018,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12750,"ABSTRACTThe 30-year U.S. swap spreads have been negative since September 2008. We offer a novel explanation for this persistent anomaly. Through an illustrative model, we show that underfunded pension plans optimally use swaps for duration hedging. Combined with dealer banks' balance sheet constraints, this demand can drive swap spreads to become negative. Empirically, we construct a measure of the aggregate funding status of defined benefit pension plans and show that this measure helps explain 30-year swap spreads. We find a similar link between pension funds' underfunding and swap spreads for two other regions."
"Stealing Deposits: Deposit Insurance, Risk-Taking, and the Removal of Market Discipline in Early 20th-Century Banks",CHARLES W. CALOMIRIS,16 December 2018,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12753,"ABSTRACTDeposit insurance reduces liquidity risk but can increase insolvency risk by encouraging reckless behavior. Several U.S. states installed deposit insurance laws before the creation of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and those laws applied only to some depository institutions within those states. These experiments present a unique testing ground for investigating the effect of deposit insurance. We show that deposit insurance removed market discipline constraining uninsured banks. Taking advantage of World War I's rise in world agricultural prices, insured banks increased their insolvency risk and competed aggressively for deposits. When prices fell after the war, the insurance systems collapsed and suffered high losses."
Who Finances Durable Goods and Why It Matters: Captive Finance and the Coase Conjecture,JUSTIN MURFIN,19 December 2018,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12745,"ABSTRACTWe propose that, by financing their own product sales through captive finance subsidiaries, durable goods manufacturers commit to higher resale values for their products in future periods. Using data on captive financing by the manufacturers of heavy equipment, we find that captive-backed models have lower price depreciation. The evidence is consistent with captive finance helping manufacturers commit to ex-post actions that support used machine prices. This, in turn, conveys higher pledgeability for captive-backed products, even for individual machines financed by banks. Although motivated as a rent-seeking device, captive financing generates positive spillovers by relaxing credit constraints."
The Dynamic Properties of Financial-Market Equilibrium with Trading Fees,ADRIAN BUSS,12 December 2018,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12744,"ABSTRACTWe incorporate trading fees into a dynamic, multiagent general-equilibrium model in which traders optimally decide when to trade. For that purpose, we propose an innovative algorithm that synchronizes the traders. Securities prices are not so much affected by the payment of the fees itself, but rather by the trade-off that the traders face between smoothing consumption and smoothing holdings. In calibrated examples, the interest rate and welfare decline with trading fees, while risk premia and volatilities increase. Liquidity risk and expected liquidity are priced, leading to deviations from the consumption-CAPM. With trading fees, capital is slow-moving, generating slow price reversal."
Equity Misvaluation and Default Options,ASSAF EISDORFER,18 December 2018,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12748,"ABSTRACTWe study whether default options are mispriced in equity values by employing a structural equity valuation model that explicitly takes into account the value of the option to default (or abandon the firm) and uses firm-specific inputs. We implement our model on the entire cross section of stocks and identify both over- and underpriced equities. An investment strategy that buys undervalued stocks and shorts overvalued stocks generates an annual four-factor alpha of about 11% for U.S. stocks. The model's performance is stronger for stocks with a higher value of the default option, such as distressed or highly volatile stocks."
Stockholders’ Unrealized Returns and the Market Reaction to Financial Disclosures,ERIC WEISBROD,13 December 2018,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12743,"ABSTRACTUsing both investor- and stock-level data, I examine the relation between stockholders’ unrealized returns since purchase and the market response to earnings announcements. I demonstrate that stockholders’ unrealized gain/loss position moderates their trading behavior in response to earnings announcements. I also find that this behavior generates a short-window return underreaction to earnings news. My results are generally consistent with predictions from prospect theory regarding the manner in which stockholders’ unrealized returns moderate their trading response to belief shocks. However, my results also suggest that an emotional component (i.e., regret-avoidance/pride-seeking) is necessary to explain the observed investor behavior."
Robust Measures of Earnings Surprises,CHIN-HAN CHIANG,19 December 2018,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12746,"ABSTRACTEvent studies of market efficiency measure earnings surprises using the consensus error (CE), given as actual earnings minus the average professional forecast. If a subset of forecasts can be biased, the ideal but difficult to estimate parameter-dependent alternative toCEis a nonlinear filter of individual errors that adjusts for bias. We show thatCEis a poor parameter-free approximation of this ideal measure. The fraction of misses on the same side (FOM), which discards the magnitude of misses, offers a far better approximation.FOMperforms particularly well againstCEin predicting the returns of U.S. stocks, where bias is potentially large."
Sentiment Metrics and Investor Demand,LUKE DeVAULT,17 December 2018,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12754,"ABSTRACTRecent work suggests that sentiment traders shift from safer to more speculative stocks when sentiment increases. Exploiting these cross-sectional patterns and changes in share ownership, we find that sentiment metrics capture institutional rather than individual investors’ demand shocks. We investigate the underlying economic mechanisms and find that common institutional investment styles (e.g., risk management, momentum trading) explain a significant portion of the relation between institutions and sentiment."
Cautious Risk Takers: Investor Preferences and Demand for Active Management,VALERY POLKOVNICHENKO,13 December 2018,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12747,"ABSTRACTDespite their mediocre mean performance, actively managed mutual funds are distinct from passive funds in their return distributions. Active value funds better hedge downside risk, while active growth funds better capture upside potential. Since such performance features may appeal to investors with tail-overweighting preferences, we show that preferences for downside protection and upside potential estimated from the empirical pricing kernel can help explain active fund flows in the value and growth categories, respectively. This effect of investor risk preferences varies significantly with funds' downside-hedging and upside-capturing ability, with levels of active management, and across retirement and retail funds."
Asset Allocation in Bankruptcy,SHAI BERNSTEIN,25 October 2018,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12740,"ABSTRACTThis paper investigates the consequences of liquidation and reorganization on the allocation and subsequent utilization of assets in bankruptcy. Using the random assignment of judges to bankruptcy cases as a natural experiment that forces some firms into liquidation, we find that the long-run utilization of assets of liquidated firms is lower relative to assets of reorganized firms. These effects are concentrated in thin markets with few potential users and in areas with low access to finance. These findings suggest that when search frictions are large, liquidation can lead to inefficient allocation of assets in bankruptcy."
"The International Bank Lending Channel of Monetary Policy Rates and QE: Credit Supply, Reach-for-Yield, and Real Effects",BERNARDO MORAIS,25 October 2018,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12735,"ABSTRACTWe identify the international credit channel by exploiting Mexican supervisory data sets and foreign monetary policy shocks in a country with a large presence of European and U.S. banks. A softening of foreign monetary policy expands credit supply of foreign banks (e.g., U.K. policy affects credit supply in Mexico via U.K. banks), inducing strong firm-level real effects. Results support an international risk-taking channel and spillovers of core countries’ monetary policies to emerging markets, both in the foreign monetary softening part (with higher credit and liquidity risk-taking by foreign banks) and in the tightening part (with negative local firm-level real effects)."
Dealer Networks,DAN LI,06 October 2018,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12728,"ABSTRACTDealers in the over-the-counter municipal bond market form trading networks with other dealers to mitigate search frictions. Regulatory data show that this network has a core-periphery structure with 10 to 30 hubs and over 2,000 peripheral broker-dealers in which bonds flow from periphery to core and partially back. Central dealers charge investors up to double the round-trip markups compared to peripheral dealers. In turn, central dealers provide immediacy by matching buyers with sellers more directly and prearranging fewer trades, especially during stress times. Investors thus face a trade-off between execution cost and speed, consistent with network models of decentralized trade."
Funding Value Adjustments,LEIF ANDERSEN,26 October 2018,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12739,"ABSTRACTIn this paper, we demonstrate that the funding value adjustments (FVAs) of major dealers are debt overhang costs to their shareholders. To maximize shareholder value, dealer quotations therefore adjust for FVAs. Our case studies include interest-rate swap FVAs and violations of covered interest parity. Contrary to current valuation practice, FVAs are not themselves components of the market values of the positions being financed. Current dealer practice does, however, align incentives between trading desks and shareholders. We also establish a pecking order for preferred asset financing strategies and provide a new interpretation of the standard debit value adjustment."
How Crashes Develop: Intradaily Volatility and Crash Evolution,DAVID S. BATES,06 October 2018,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12732,"ABSTRACTThis paper explores whether affine models with volatility jumps estimated on intradaily S&P 500 futures data over 1983 to 2008 can capture major daily outliers such as the 1987 stock market crash. Intradaily jumps in futures prices are typically small; self-exciting but short-lived volatility spikes capture intradaily and daily returns better. Multifactor models of the evolution of diffusive variance and jump intensities improve fits substantially, including out-of-sample over 2009 to 2016. The models capture reasonably well the conditional distributions of daily returns and realized variance outliers, but underpredict realized variance inliers. I also examine option pricing implications."
Basis-Momentum,MARTIJN BOONS,24 October 2018,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12738,"ABSTRACTWe introduce a return predictor related to the slope and curvature of the futures term structure: basis-momentum. Basis-momentum strongly outperforms benchmark characteristics in predicting commodity spot and term premiums in both the time series and the cross section. Exposure to basis-momentum is priced among commodity-sorted portfolios and individual commodities. We argue that basis-momentum captures imbalances in the supply and demand of futures contracts that materialize when the market-clearing ability of speculators and intermediaries is impaired, and that it represents compensation for priced risk. Our findings are inconsistent with alternative explanations based on storage, inventory, and hedging pressure."
Investment and the Cross-Section of Equity Returns,GIAN LUCA CLEMENTI,08 October 2018,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12730,"ABSTRACTThe data show that, upon being hit by adverse profitability shocks, large public firms have ample latitude to divest their least productive assets, reducing the risk faced by shareholders and the returns that they are likely to demand. In the one-factor production-based asset pricing model, when the frictions to capital adjustment are shaped to respect the evidence on investment, the model-generated cross-sectional dispersion of returns is only a small fraction of that documented in the data. Our conclusions hold even when operating or labor leverage is modeled in ways shown to be promising in the extant literature."
(Almost) Model-Free Recovery,PAUL SCHNEIDER,25 October 2018,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12737,"ABSTRACTUnder mild assumptions, we recover the model-free conditional minimum variance projection of the pricing kernel on various tradeable realized moments of market returns. Recovered conditional moments predict future realizations and give insight into the cyclicality of equity premia, variance risk premia, and the highest attainable Sharpe ratios under the minimum variance probability. The pricing kernel projections are oftenU-shaped and give rise to optimal conditional portfolio strategies with plausible market timing properties, moderate countercyclical exposures to higher realized moments, and favorable out-of-sample Sharpe ratios."
Financial Markets Where Traders Neglect the Informational Content of Prices,ERIK EYSTER,08 October 2018,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12729,"ABSTRACTWe model a financial market where some traders of a risky asset do not fully appreciate what prices convey about others' private information. Markets comprising solely such “cursed” traders generate more trade than those comprising solely rationals. Because rationals arbitrage away distortions caused by cursed traders, mixed markets can generate even more trade. Per-trader volume in cursed markets increases with market size; volume may instead disappear when traders infer others' information from prices, even when they dismiss it as noisier than their own. Making private information public raises rational and “dismissive” volume, but reduces cursed volume given moderate noninformational trading motives."
"Dividend Dynamics, Learning, and Expected Stock Index Returns",RAVI JAGANNATHAN,08 October 2018,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12731,"ABSTRACTWe present a latent variable model of dividends that predicts, out-of-sample, 39.5% to 41.3% of the variation in annual dividend growth rates between 1975 and 2016. Further, when learning about dividend dynamics is incorporated into a long-run risks model, the model predicts, out-of-sample, 25.3% to 27.1% of the variation in annual stock index returns over the same time horizon, with learning contributing approximately half of the predictability in returns. These findings support the view that investors' aversion to long-run risks and their learning about these risks are important in determining stock index prices and expected returns."
Sparse Signals in the Cross-Section of Returns,ALEX CHINCO,09 October 2018,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12733,"ABSTRACTThis paper applies the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) to make rolling one-minute-ahead return forecasts using the entire cross-section of lagged returns as candidate predictors. The LASSO increases both out-of-sample fit and forecast-implied Sharpe ratios. This out-of-sample success comes from identifying predictors that are unexpected, short-lived, and sparse. Although the LASSO uses a statistical rule rather than economic intuition to identify predictors, the predictors it identifies are nevertheless associated with economically meaningful events: the LASSO tends to identify as predictors stocks with news about fundamentals."
A Test of the Modigliani-Miller Invariance Theorem and Arbitrage in Experimental Asset Markets,GARY CHARNESS,25 October 2018,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12736,"ABSTRACTModigliani and Miller show that the total market value of a firm is unaffected by a repackaging of asset return streams to equity and debt if pricing is arbitrage-free. We investigate this invariance theorem in experimental asset markets, finding value-invariance for assets of identical risks when returns are perfectly correlated. However, exploiting price discrepancies has risk when returns have the same expected value but are uncorrelated, in which case the law of one price is violated. Discrepancies shrink in consecutive markets, but persist even with experienced traders. In markets where overall trader acuity is high, assets trade closer to parity."

Local Crowding-Out in China,YI HUANG,26 July 2020,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12966,"ABSTRACTIn China, between 2006 and 2013, local public debt crowded out the investment of private firms by tightening their funding constraints while leaving state-owned firms' investment unaffected. We establish this result using a purpose-built data set for Chinese local public debt. Private firms invest less in cities with more public debt, with the reduction in investment larger for firms located farther from banks in other cities or more dependent on external funding. Moreover, in cities where public debt is high, private firms' investment is more sensitive to internal cash flow."
"Every Cloud Has a Silver Lining: Fast Trading, Microwave Connectivity, and Trading Costs",ANDRIY SHKILKO,27 July 2020,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12969,"ABSTRACTModern markets are characterized by speed differentials, with some traders being fractions of a second faster than others. Theoretical models suggest that such differentials may have both positive and negative effects on liquidity and gains from trade. We examine these effects by studying a series of exogenous weather episodes that temporarily remove the speed advantages of the fastest traders by disrupting their microwave networks. The disruptions are associated with lower adverse selection and lower trading costs. In additional analysis, we show that the long-term removal of speed differentials results in similar effects and also increases gains from trade."
Credit Rating Inflation and Firms' Investments,ITAY GOLDSTEIN,10 July 2020,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12961,"ABSTRACTWe analyze credit rating effects on firm investments in a rational bond financing game that features a feedback loop. The credit rating agency (CRA) inflates the rating, providing a biased but informative signal to creditors. Creditors' response to the rating affects the firm's investment decision and thus its credit quality, which is reflected in the rating. The CRA might reduce ex ante economic efficiency, which results solely from its strategic effect: the CRA assigns more firms high ratings and allows them to gamble for resurrection. We derive empirical predictions on the determinants of rating standards and inflation and discuss policy implications."
Safety Transformation and the Structure of the Financial System,WILLIAM DIAMOND,27 July 2020,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12967,"ABSTRACTThis paper studies how a financial system that is organized to efficiently create safe assets responds to macroeconomic shocks. Financial intermediaries face a cost of bearing risk, so they choose the least risky portfolio that backs their issuance of riskless deposits: a diversified pool of nonfinancial firms' debt. Nonfinancial firms choose their capital structure to exploit the resulting segmentation between debt and equity markets. Increased safe asset demand yields larger and riskier intermediaries and more levered firms. Quantitative easing reduces the size and riskiness of intermediaries and can decrease firm leverage, despite reducing borrowing costs at the zero lower bound."
The Forced Safety Effect: How Higher Capital Requirements Can Increase Bank Lending,SALEEM BAHAJ,10 July 2020,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12958,"ABSTRACTGovernment guarantees generate an implicit subsidy for banks. A capital requirement reduces this subsidy, through a simple liability composition effect. However, the guarantees also make a bank undervalue loans that generates surplus in states of the world in which it defaults. Raising the capital requirement makes the bank safer, which alleviates this problem. We refer to this mechanism, which we argue is empirically relevant, as theforced safety effect."
Monetary Policy and Global Banking,FALK BRÄUNING,10 July 2020,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12959,"ABSTRACTWhen central banks adjust interest rates, the opportunity cost of lending in local currency changes, but—absent frictions—there is no spillover effect to lending in other currencies. However, when equity capital is limited, global banks must benchmark domestic and foreign lending opportunities. We show that, in equilibrium, the marginal return on foreign lending is affected by the interest rate differential, with lower domestic rates leading to an increase in local lending, at the expense of a reduction in foreign lending. We test our prediction in the context of changes in interest rates in six major currency areas."
"Sovereign Debt Portfolios, Bond Risks, and the Credibility of Monetary Policy",WENXIN DU,26 July 2020,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12965,"ABSTRACTWe document that governments whose local currency debt provides them with greater hedging benefits actually borrow more in foreign currency. We introduce two features into a government's debt portfolio choice problem to explain this finding: risk-averse lenders and lack of monetary policy commitment. A government without commitment chooses excessively countercyclical inflation ex post, which leads risk-averse lenders to require a risk premium ex ante. This makes local currency debt too expensive from the government's perspective and thereby discourages the government from borrowing in its own currency."
The Employment Effects of Faster Payment: Evidence from the Federal Quickpay Reform,JEAN-NOËL BARROT,02 June 2020,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12955,"ABSTRACTWe study the impact ofQuickpay, a reform that permanently accelerated payments to small business contractors of the U.S. government. We find a strong direct effect of the reform on employment growth at the firm level. However, we document substantial crowding out of nontreated firms' employment within local labor markets. While the overall net employment effect is positive, it is close to zero in tight labor markets. Our results highlight an important channel for alleviating financing constraints in small firms, but emphasize the general-equilibrium effects of large-scale interventions, which can lead to lower aggregate outcomes depending on labor market conditions."
Stock Market Returns and Consumption,MARCO DI MAGGIO,27 July 2020,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12968,ABSTRACTThis paper employs Swedish data on households' stock holdings to investigate how consumption responds to changes in stock market returns. We instrument the actual capital gains and dividend payments with past portfolio weights. Unrealized capital gains lead to a marginal propensity to consume of 23% for the bottom 50% of the wealth distribution and about 3% for the top 30% of the wealth distribution. Household consumption is significantly more responsive to dividend payouts across all parts of the wealth distribution. Our findings are consistent with households treating capital gains and dividends as separate sources of income.
Measuring Mutual Fund Flow Pressure as Shock to Stock Returns,MALCOLM WARDLAW,11 July 2020,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12962,"ABSTRACTA large and rapidly growing literature examines the impact of misvaluation on firm policies by using mutual fund outflow-induced price pressure to isolate nonfundamental price variation. I demonstrate that the standard approach to computing outflow-induced price pressure produces a measure that is inadvertently a direct function of a stock's actual realized return during the outflow quarter, raising doubts about its orthogonality to fundamentals. After removing these direct measurements of return, outflows generate a fairly negligible quarterly decline in returns, with no subsequent reversal, and many established results in this literature no longer hold. I provide suggestions for future analysis."

"No Job, No Money, No Refi: Frictions to Refinancing in a Recession",ANTHONY A. DEFUSCO,01 June 2020,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12952,"ABSTRACTWe study how employment documentation requirements and out-of-pocket closing costs constrain mortgage refinancing. These frictions, which bind most severely during recessions, may significantly inhibit monetary policy pass-through. To study their effects on refinancing, we exploit a Federal Housing Administration policy change that excluded unemployed borrowers from refinancing and increased others' out-of-pocket costs substantially. These changes dramatically reduced refinancing rates, particularly among the likely unemployed and those facing new out-of-pocket costs. Our results imply that unemployed and liquidity-constrained borrowers have a high latent demand for refinancing. Cyclical variation in these factors may therefore affect both the aggregate and distributional consequences of monetary policy."
"Bad Credit, No Problem? Credit and Labor Market Consequences of Bad Credit Reports",WILL DOBBIE,01 June 2020,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12954,"ABSTRACTWe study the financial and labor market impacts of bad credit reports. Using difference-in-differences variation from the staggered removal of bankruptcy flags, we show that bankruptcy flag removal leads to economically large increases in credit limits and borrowing. Using administrative tax records linked to personal bankruptcy records, we estimate economically small effects of flag removal on employment and earnings outcomes. We rationalize these contrasting results by showing that, conditional on basic observables, “hidden” bankruptcy flags are strongly correlated with adverse credit market outcomes but have no predictive power for measures of job performance."
Declining Labor and Capital Shares,SIMCHA BARKAI,26 April 2020,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12909,"ABSTRACTThis paper presents direct measures of capital costs, equal to the product of the required rate of return on capital and the value of the capital stock. The capital share, equal to the ratio of capital costs and gross value added, does not offset the decline in the labor share. Instead, a large increase in the share of pure profits offsets declines in the shares of both labor and capital. Industry data show that increases in concentration are associated with declines in the labor share."
The Banking View of Bond Risk Premia,VALENTIN HADDAD,20 May 2020,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12949,"ABSTRACTBanks' balance sheet exposure to fluctuations in interest rates strongly forecasts excess Treasury bond returns. This result is consistent with optimal risk management, a banking counterpart to the household Euler equation. In equilibrium, the bond risk premium compensates banks for bearing fluctuations in interest rates. When banks' exposure to interest rate risk increases, the price of this risk simultaneously rises. We present a collection of empirical observations that support this view, but also discuss several challenges to this interpretation."
False (and Missed) Discoveries in Financial Economics,CAMPBELL R. HARVEY,19 May 2020,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12951,"ABSTRACTMultiple testing plagues many important questions in finance such as fund and factor selection. We propose a new way to calibrate both Type I and Type II errors. Next, using a double-bootstrap method, we establish at-statistic hurdle that is associated with a specific false discovery rate (e.g., 5%). We also establish a hurdle that is associated with a certain acceptable ratio of misses to false discoveries (Type II error scaled by Type I error), which effectively allows for differential costs of the two types of mistakes. Evaluating current methods, we find that they lack power to detect outperforming managers."
The Mismatch Between Mutual Fund Scale and Skill,YANG SONG,20 May 2020,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12950,ABSTRACTI demonstrate that skill and scale are mismatched among actively managed equity mutual funds. Many mutual fund investors confuse the effects of fund exposures to common systematic factors with managerial skill when allocating capital among funds. Active mutual funds with positive factor-related past returns thus accumulate assets to the point that they significantly underperform. I also show that the negative aggregate benchmark-adjusted performance of active equity mutual funds is driven mainly by these oversized funds.
Price and Probability: Decomposing the Takeover Effects of Anti-Takeover Provisions,VICENTE CUÑAT,22 April 2020,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12908,"ABSTRACTWe study the effects of anti-takeover provisions (ATPs) on the takeover probability, the takeover premium, and target selection. Voting to remove an ATP increases both the takeover probability and the takeover premium, that is, there is no evidence of a trade-off between premiums and takeover probabilities. We provide causal estimates based on shareholder proposals to remove ATPs and address the endogenous selection of targets through bounding techniques. The positive premium effect in less protected firms is driven by better bidder-target matching and merger synergies."
The Causal Effect of Limits to Arbitrage on Asset Pricing Anomalies,YONGQIANG CHU,21 May 2020,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12947,"ABSTRACTWe examine the causal effect of limits to arbitrage on 11 well-known asset pricing anomalies using the pilot program of Regulation SHO, which relaxed short-sale constraints for a quasi-random set of pilot stocks, as a natural experiment. We find that the anomalies became weaker on portfolios constructed with pilot stocks during the pilot period. The pilot program reduced the combined anomaly long–short portfolio returns by 72 basis points per month, a difference that survives risk adjustment with standard factor models. The effect comes only from the short legs of the anomaly portfolios."
Low-Risk Anomalies?,PAUL SCHNEIDER,26 April 2020,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12910,"ABSTRACTThis paper shows that low-risk anomalies in the capital asset pricing model and in traditional factor models arise when investors require compensation for coskewness risk. Empirically, we find that option-implied ex ante skewness is strongly related to ex post residual coskewness, which allows us to construct coskewness factor-mimicking portfolios. Controlling for skewness renders the alphas of betting-against-beta and betting-against-volatility insignificant. We also show that the returns of beta- and volatility-sorted portfolios are driven largely by a single principal component, which in turn is explained largely by skewness."
Market Structure and Transaction Costs of Index CDSs,PIERRE COLLIN-DUFRESNE,01 June 2020,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12953,"ABSTRACTDespite regulatory efforts to promote all-to-all trading, the post–Dodd-Frank index credit default swap market remains two-tiered. Transaction costs are higher for dealer-to-client than interdealer trades, but the difference is explained by the higher, largely permanent, price impact of client trades. Most interdealer trades are liquidity motivated and executed via low-cost, low-immediacy trading protocols. Dealer-to-client trades are nonanonymous; they almost always improve upon contemporaneous executable interdealer quotes, and dealers appear to price discriminate based on the perceived price impact of trades. Our results suggest that the market structure is a consequence of the characteristics of client trades: relatively infrequent, large, and differentially informed."
The Impact of Supervision on Bank Performance,BEVERLY HIRTLE,12 July 2020,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12964,"ABSTRACTWe explore the impact of supervision on the riskiness, profitability, and growth of U.S. banks. Using data on supervisors' time use, we demonstrate that the top-ranked banks by size within a supervisory district receive more attention from supervisors, even after controlling for size, complexity, risk, and other characteristics. Using a matched sample approach, we find that these top-ranked banks that receive more supervisory attention hold less risky loan portfolios, are less volatile, and are less sensitive to industry downturns, but do not have lower growth or profitability. Our results underscore the distinct role of supervision in mitigating banking sector risk."
A Macrofinance View of U.S. Sovereign CDS Premiums,MIKHAIL CHERNOV,20 May 2020,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12948,"ABSTRACTPremiums on U.S. sovereign credit default swaps (CDS) have risen to persistently elevated levels since the financial crisis. We examine whether these premiums reflect the probability of a fiscal default—a state in which a balanced budget can no longer be restored by raising taxes or eroding the real value of debt by increasing inflation. We develop an equilibrium macrofinance model in which the fiscal and monetary policy stances jointly endogenously determine nominal debt, taxes, inflation, and growth. We show that the CDS premiums reflect the endogenous risk-adjusted probabilities of fiscal default. The calibrated model is consistent with elevated levels of CDS premiums but leaves dynamic implications quantitatively unresolved."
Presidential Address: Social Transmission Bias in Economics and Finance,DAVID HIRSHLEIFER,27 May 2020,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12906,"ABSTRACTI discuss a new intellectual paradigm,social economics and finance—the study of the social processes that shape economic thinking and behavior. This emerging field recognizes that people observe and talk to each other. A key, underexploited building block of social economics and finance issocial transmission bias: systematic directional shift in signals or ideas induced by social transactions. I use five “fables” (models) to illustrate the novelty and scope of the transmission bias approach, and offer several emergent themes. For example, social transmission bias compounds recursively, which can help explain booms, bubbles, return anomalies, and swings in economic sentiment."
Political Connections and the Informativeness of Insider Trades,ALAN D. JAGOLINZER,20 March 2020,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12899,"ABSTRACTWe analyze the trading of corporate insiders at leading financial institutions during the 2007 to 2009 financial crisis. We find strong evidence of a relation between political connections and informed trading during the period in which Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) funds were disbursed, and that the relation is most pronounced among corporate insiders with recent direct connections. Notably, we find evidence of abnormal trading by politically connected insiders 30 days in advance of TARP infusions, and that these trades anticipate the market reaction to the infusion. Our results suggest that political connections can facilitate opportunistic behavior by corporate insiders."
Do CEOs Matter? Evidence from Hospitalization Events,MORTEN BENNEDSEN,03 March 2020,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12897,"ABSTRACTUsing variation in firms’ exposure to their CEOs resulting from hospitalization, we estimate the effect of chief executive officers (CEOs) on firm policies, holding firm-CEO matches constant. We document three main findings. First, CEOs have a significant effect on profitability and investment. Second, CEO effects are larger for younger CEOs, in growing and family-controlled firms, and in human-capital-intensive industries. Third, CEOs are unique: the hospitalization of other senior executives does not have similar effects on the performance. Overall, our findings demonstrate that CEOs are a key driver of firm performance, which suggests that CEO contingency plans are valuable."
Is Bitcoin Really Untethered?,JOHN M. GRIFFIN,15 June 2020,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12903,"ABSTRACTThis paper investigates whether Tether, a digital currency pegged to the U.S. dollar, influenced Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency prices during the 2017 boom. Using algorithms to analyze blockchain data, we find that purchases with Tether are timed following market downturns and result in sizable increases in Bitcoin prices. The flow is attributable to one entity, clusters below round prices, induces asymmetric autocorrelations in Bitcoin, and suggests insufficient Tether reserves before month-ends. Rather than demand from cash investors, these patterns are most consistent with the supply-based hypothesis of unbacked digital money inflating cryptocurrency prices."
What Matters to Individual Investors? Evidence from the Horse's Mouth,JAMES J. CHOI,25 February 2020,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12895,"ABSTRACTWe survey a representative sample of U.S. individuals about how well leading academic theories describe their financial beliefs and decisions. We find substantial support for many factors hypothesized to affect portfolio equity share, particularly background risk, investment horizon, rare disasters, transactional factors, and fixed costs of stock market participation. Individuals tend to believe that past mutual fund performance is a good signal of stock-picking skill, actively managed funds do not suffer from diseconomies of scale, value stocks are safer and do not have higher expected returns, and high-momentum stocks are riskier and do have higher expected returns."
The Value of Central Clearing,GUILLAUME VUILLEMEY,18 March 2020,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12902,"ABSTRACTI study a contracting innovation that suddenly insulated traders of hedging contracts against counterparty risk: central clearing counterparties (CCPs) for derivatives. The first CCP was created in Le Havre (France) in 1882, in the coffee futures market. Using triple difference-in-differences estimation, I show that central clearing changed the geography of trade flows Europe-wide, to the benefit of Le Havre. Inspecting the mechanism using trader-level data, I find that the CCP solved both a “missing market” problem and adverse selection issues. Central clearing also facilitated entry of new traders in the market. The successful contracting innovation quickly spread to other exchanges."
Informational Frictions and the Credit Crunch,OLIVIER DARMOUNI,19 March 2020,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12900,"ABSTRACTIn this paper, I estimate the magnitude of an informational friction limiting credit reallocation to firms during the 2007 to 2009 financial crisis. Because lenders rely on private information when deciding which relationship to end, borrowers looking for a new lender are adversely selected. I show how to separately identify private information from information common to all lenders but unobservable to the econometrician by using bank shocks within a discrete choice model of relationships. Quantitatively, these informational frictions appear to be too small to explain the credit crunch in the U.S. syndicated corporate loan market."
Debt Contracting on Management,BRIAN AKINS,19 February 2020,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12893,"ABSTRACTChange of management restrictions (CMRs) in loan contracts give lenders explicit ex ante control rights over managerial retention and selection. This paper shows that lenders use CMRs to mitigate risks arising from CEO turnover, especially those related to the loss of human capital and replacement uncertainty, thereby providing evidence that human capital risk affects debt contracting. With a CMR in place, the likelihood of CEO turnover decreases by more than half, and future firm performance improves when retention frictions are important, suggesting that lenders can influence managerial turnover, even outside of default states, and help the borrower retain talent."
"Bank Quality, Judicial Efficiency, and Loan Repayment Delays in Italy",FABIO SCHIANTARELLI,20 February 2020,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12896,"ABSTRACTItalian firms delay payment to banks weakened by past loan losses. Exploiting Credit Register data, we fully absorb borrower fundamentals with firm-quarter effects. Identification therefore reflects firm choices to delay payment to some banks, depending on their health. This selective delay occurs more where legal enforcement of collateral recovery is slow. Poor enforcement encourages borrowers not to pay when the value of their bank relationship comes into doubt. Selective delays occur even by firms able to pay all lenders. Credit losses in Italy have thus been worsened by the combination of weak banks and weak legal enforcement."
Understanding Systematic Risk: A High-Frequency Approach,MARKUS PELGER,20 March 2020,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12898,"ABSTRACTBased on a novel high-frequency data set for a large number of firms, I estimate the time-varying latent continuous and jump factors that explain individual stock returns. The factors are estimated using principal component analysis applied to a local volatility and jump covariance matrix. I find four stable continuous systematic factors, which can be well approximated by a market, oil, finance, and electricity portfolio, while there is only one stable jump market factor. The exposure of stocks to these risk factors and their explained variation is time-varying. The four continuous factors carry an intraday risk premium that reverses overnight."
Cash Flow News and Stock Price Dynamics,DAVIDE PETTENUZZO,03 April 2020,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12901,"ABSTRACTWe develop a new approach to modeling dynamics in cash flows extracted from daily firm-level dividend announcements. We decompose daily cash flow news into a persistent component, jumps, and temporary shocks. Empirically, we find that the persistent cash flow component is a highly significant predictor of future growth in dividends and consumption. Using a log-linearized present value model, we show that news about the persistent dividend growth component predicts stock returns consistent with asset pricing constraints implied by this model. News about the daily dividend growth process also helps explain concurrent return volatility and the probability of jumps in stock returns."
Option Profit and Loss Attribution and Pricing: A New Framework,PETER CARR,19 February 2020,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12894,"ABSTRACTThis paper develops a new top-down valuation framework that links the pricing of an option investment to its daily profit and loss attribution. The framework uses the Black-Merton-Scholes option pricing formula to attribute the short-term option investment risk to variation in the underlying security price and the option's implied volatility. Taking risk-neutral expectation and demanding no dynamic arbitrage result in a pricing relation that links an option's fair implied volatility level to the underlying volatility level with corrections for the implied volatility's own expected direction of movement, its variance, and its covariance with the underlying security return."
Corporate Control around the World,GUR AMINADAV,31 January 2020,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12889,"ABSTRACTWe study corporate control tracing controlling shareholders for thousands of listed firms from 127 countries over 2004 to 2012. Government and family control is pervasive in civil-law countries. Blocks are commonplace, but less so in common-law countries. These patterns apply to large, medium, and small firms. In contrast, the development-control nexus is heterogeneous; strong for large but absent for small firms. Control correlates strongly with shareholder protection, the stringency of employment contracts and unions power. Conversely, the correlations with creditor rights, legal formalism, and entry regulation appear weak. These patterns support both legal origin and political theories of financial development."
Can Unemployment Insurance Spur Entrepreneurial Activity? Evidence from France,JOHAN HOMBERT,22 January 2020,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12880,"ABSTRACTWe evaluate the effect of downside insurance on self-employment. We exploit a large-scale reform of French unemployment benefits that insured unemployed workers starting businesses. The reform significantly increased firm creation without decreasing the quality of new entrants. Firms started postreform were initially smaller, but their employment growth, productivity, and survival rates are similar to those prereform. New entrepreneurs' characteristics and expectations are also similar. Finally, jobs created by new entrants crowd out employment in incumbent firms almost one-for-one, but have a higher productivity than incumbents. These results highlight the benefits of encouraging experimentation by lowering barriers to entry."
Drilling and Debt,ERIK P. GILJE,05 February 2020,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12884,"ABSTRACTThis paper documents a previously unrecognized debt-related investment distortion. Using detailed project-level data for 69 firms in the oil and gas industry, we find that highly levered firms pull forward investment, completing projects early at the expense of long-run project returns and project value. This behavior is particularly pronounced prior to debt renegotiations. We test several channels that could explain this behavior and find evidence consistent with equity holders sacrificing long-run project returns to enhance collateral values and, by extension, mitigate lending frictions at debt renegotiations."
Taming the Factor Zoo: A Test of New Factors,GUANHAO FENG,24 January 2020,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12883,"ABSTRACTWe propose a model selection method to systematically evaluate the contribution to asset pricing of any new factor, above and beyond what a high-dimensional set of existing factors explains. Our methodology accounts formodel selection mistakesthat produce a bias due to omitted variables, unlike standard approaches that assume perfect variable selection. We apply our procedure to a set of factors recently discovered in the literature. While most of these new factors are shown to be redundant relative to the existing factors, a few have statistically significant explanatory power beyond the hundreds of factors proposed in the past."
Lazy Prices,LAUREN COHEN,28 January 2020,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12885,"ABSTRACTUsing the complete history of regular quarterly and annual filings by U.S. corporations, we show that changes to the language and construction of financial reports have strong implications for firms’ future returns and operations. A portfolio that shorts “changers” and buys “nonchangers” earns up to 188 basis points per month in alpha (over 22% per year) in the future. Moreover, changes to 10-Ks predict future earnings, profitability, future news announcements, and even future firm-level bankruptcies. Unlike typical underreaction patterns, we find no announcement effect, suggesting that investors are inattentive to these simple changes across the universe of public firms."
What Drives Anomaly Returns?,LARS A. LOCHSTOER,17 January 2020,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12876,"ABSTRACTWe decompose the returns of five well-known anomalies into cash flow and discount rate news. Common patterns emerge across the five factor portfolios and their mean-variance efficient (MVE) combination. Whereas discount rate news predominates in market returns, systematic cash flow news drives the returns of anomaly portfolios and their MVE combination with the market portfolio. Anomaly cash flow and discount rate shocks are largely uncorrelated with market cash flow and discount rate shocks and with business cycle fluctuations. These rich empirical patterns restrict the joint dynamics of firm cash flows and the pricing kernel, thereby informing models of stocks' expected returns."
Necessary and Sufficient Conditions for Existence and Uniqueness of Recursive Utilities,JAROSLAV BOROVIČKA,15 January 2020,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12877,"ABSTRACTWe obtain exact necessary and sufficient conditions for existence and uniqueness of solutions of a class of homothetic recursive utility models postulated by Epstein and Zin. The conditions center on a single test value with a natural economic interpretation. The test sheds light on the relationship between valuation of cash flows, impatience, risk adjustment, and intertemporal substitution of consumption. We propose two methods to compute the test value when an analytical solution is not available. We further provide several applications."
High-Frequency Trading and Market Performance,MARKUS BALDAUF,23 January 2020,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12882,"ABSTRACTWe study the consequences of, and potential policy responses to, high-frequency trading (HFT) via the tradeoff between liquidity and information production. Faster speeds facilitate HFT, with consequences for this tradeoff: Information production decreases because informed traders have less time to trade before HFTs react, but liquidity (measured by the bid-ask spread) improves because informational asymmetries decline. HFT also pushes outcomes inside the frontier of this tradeoff. However, outcomes can be restored to the frontier by replacing the limit order book with one of two alternative mechanisms: delaying all orders except cancellations or implementing frequent batch auctions."
Venturing beyond the IPO: Financing of Newly Public Firms by Venture Capitalists,PETER ILIEV,24 February 2020,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12879,"ABSTRACTContrary to conventional wisdom, we document that approximately 15% of venture capitalist (VC)-backed firms raise additional capital from VCs in the five years after going public. We propose two explanations for why firms revert to VC financing post-IPO (initial public offering). First, we hypothesize that VC participation in post-IPO financing represents an efficient solution to informational problems that would otherwise constrain firms’ abilities to exploit value-increasing investments. Analyses of firm and VC characteristics, together with the finding that these investments are value-increasing for both VCs and the underlying companies, support this hypothesis. We find no support for the alternative that agency conflicts motivate these investments."
Insider Investment Horizon,FERHAT AKBAS,23 January 2020,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12878,"ABSTRACTWe examine the relation between insiders’ investment horizon and the information content of their trades with respect to future stock returns. We conjecture that an insider's investment horizon establishes a benchmark for expected patterns of continued trading behavior and thus helps identify unexpected insider trades, which should be more informative in efficient markets. Consistent with this conjecture, the trades of short-horizon insiders are both more unexpected and more informed, on average, than those of long-horizon insiders. Short-horizon insiders and their firms also tend to display characteristics that are associated with a greater focus on short-termism."
How Skilled Are Security Analysts?,ALAN CRANE,03 February 2020,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12890,"ABSTRACTThe majority of security analysts are identified as skilled when the cross-section of analyst performance is modeled as a mixture of multiple skill distributions. Analysts exhibit heterogeneous skill—some are high-type, and some are low-type. On average, the recommendation revisions of both types exhibit positive abnormal returns. The heterogeneity stems from differential ability to produce new information; all analysts can profitably process news. Top analysts outperform because more of their recommendations are influential (i.e., associated with statistically significant returns) and both their influential and noninfluential recommendations are more informative. A majority of research firms are also identified as skilled."
Consumption Fluctuations and Expected Returns,VICTORIA ATANASOV,12 December 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12870,"ABSTRACTThis paper introduces a novel consumption-based variable, cyclical consumption, and examines its predictive properties for stock returns. Future expected stock returns are high (low) when aggregate consumption falls (rises) relative to its trend and marginal utility from current consumption is high (low). We show that the empirical evidence ties consumption decisions of agents to time variation in returns in a manner consistent with asset pricing models based on external habit formation. The predictive power of cyclical consumption is not confined to bad times and subsumes the predictability of many popular forecasting variables."
Star Ratings and the Incentives of Mutual Funds,CHONG HUANG,31 January 2020,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12888,"ABSTRACTWe propose a theory of reputation to explain how investors rationally respond to mutual fund star ratings. A fund's performance is determined by its information advantage, which can be acquired but decays stochastically. Investors form beliefs about whether the fund is informed based on its past performance. We refer to such beliefs as fund reputation, which determines fund flows. As performance changes continuously, equilibrium fund reputation may take discrete values only and thus can be labeled with stars. Star upgrades thus imply reputation jumps, leading to discrete increases in flows and expected performance, although stars do not provide new information."
Retracted: Risk Management in Financial Institutions,ADRIANO A. RAMPINI,12 December 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12868,"ABSTRACTWe study risk management in financial institutions using data on hedging of interest rate and foreign exchange risk. We find strong evidence that institutions with higher net worth hedge more, controlling for risk exposures, across institutions and within institutions over time. For identification, we exploit net worth shocks resulting from loan losses due to declines in house prices. Institutions that sustain such shocks reduce hedging significantly relative to otherwise-similar institutions. The reduction in hedging is differentially larger among institutions with high real estate exposure. The evidence is consistent with the theory that financial constraints impede both financing and hedging."
What Is a Patent Worth? Evidence from the U.S. Patent “Lottery”,JOAN FARRE-MENSA,27 November 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12867,"ABSTRACTWe provide evidence on the value of patents to startups by leveraging the quasi-random assignment of applications to examiners with different propensities to grant patents. Using unique data on all first-time applications filed at the U.S. Patent Office since 2001, we find that startups that win the patent “lottery” by drawing lenient examiners have, on average, 55% higher employment growth and 80% higher sales growth five years later. Patent winners also pursue more, and higher quality, follow-on innovation. Winning a first patent boosts a startup’s subsequent growth and innovation by facilitating access to funding from venture capitalists, banks, and public investors."
Relationship Trading in Over-the-Counter Markets,TERRENCE HENDERSHOTT,15 November 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12864,"ABSTRACTWe examine the network of trading relationships between insurers and dealers in the over-the-counter (OTC) corporate bond market. Regulatory data show that one-third of insurers use a single dealer, whereas other insurers have large dealer networks. Execution prices are nonmonotone in network size, initially declining with more dealers but increasing once networks exceed 20 dealers. A model of decentralized trade in which insurers trade off the benefits of repeat business and faster execution quantitatively fits the distribution of insurers' network size and explains the price–network size relationship. Counterfactual analysis shows that regulations to unbundle trade and nontrade services can decrease welfare."
Tax-Efficient Asset Management: Evidence from Equity Mutual Funds,CLEMENS SIALM,10 October 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12843,"ABSTRACTWe investigate the relation between tax burdens and mutual fund performance from both a theoretical and an empirical perspective. The theoretical model introduces heterogeneous tax clienteles in an environment with decreasing returns to scale and shows that the equilibrium performance of mutual funds depends on the size of the tax clienteles. Our empirical results show that the performance of U.S. equity mutual funds is related to their tax burdens. We find that tax-efficient funds exhibit not only superior after-tax performance, but also superior before-tax performance due to lower trading costs, favorable style exposures, and better selectivity."
Measuring Innovation and Product Differentiation: Evidence from Mutual Funds,LEONARD KOSTOVETSKY,22 October 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12853,"ABSTRACTWe study innovation and product differentiation using a uniqueness measure based on textual analysis of prospectuses. We find that small and start-up families have higher start rates than larger families, and their products are more unique. Unique strategies attract more inflows in the first three years, and investors respond more to text-based uniqueness than other measures such as holdings or returns uniqueness. For established funds, word uniqueness has weak negative power for explaining returns, so investors in competitive equilibrium do not sacrifice much performance to get specialized products. Uniqueness attenuates the flow-performance relation, reducing the risk of investor outflows."
Beyond Random Assignment: Credible Inference and Extrapolation in Dynamic Economies,CHRISTOPHER A. HENNESSY,16 November 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12862,"ABSTRACTWe derive analytical relationships between shock responses and theory-implied causal effects (comparative statics) in dynamic settings with linear profits and linear-quadratic stock accumulation costs. For permanent profitability shocks, responses can have incorrect signs, undershoot, or overshoot depending on the size and sign of realized changes. For profitability shocks that are i.i.d., uniformly distributed, binary, or unanticipated and temporary, there is attenuation bias, which exceeds 50% under plausible parameterizations. We derive a novel sufficient condition for profitability shock responses to equal causal effects: martingale profitability. We establish a battery of sufficient conditions for correct sign estimation, including stochastic monotonicity. Simple extrapolation/error correction formulas are presented."
The Market for Conflicted Advice,BRIANA CHANG,10 October 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12848,"ABSTRACTWe present a model of the market for advice in which advisers have conflicts of interest and compete for heterogeneous customers through information provision. The competitive equilibrium features information dispersion and partial disclosure. Although conflicted fees lead to distorted information, they are irrelevant for customers' welfare: banning conflicted fees improves only the information quality, not customers' welfare. Instead, financial literacy education for the least informed customers can improve all customers' welfare because of a spillover effect. Furthermore, customers who trade through advisers realize lower average returns, which rationalizes empirical findings."
Does Borrowing from Banks Cost More than Borrowing from the Market?,MICHAEL SCHWERT,09 October 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12849,"ABSTRACTThis paper investigates the pricing of bank loans relative to capital market debt. The analysis uses a novel sample of loans matched with bond spreads from the same firm on the same date. After accounting for seniority, lenders earn a large premium relative to the bond-implied credit spread. In a sample of secured term loans to noninvestment-grade firms, the average premium is 140 to 170 bps or about half of the all-in-drawn spread. This is the first direct evidence of firms' willingness to pay for bank credit and raises questions about the nature of competition in the loan market."
How Does Credit Supply Expansion Affect the Real Economy? The Productive Capacity and Household Demand Channels,ATIF MIAN,12 December 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12869,"ABSTRACTCredit supply expansion can affect an economy by increasing productive capacity or by boosting household demand. In this study, we develop a test to determine if the household demand channel is present, and we implement the test using both a natural experiment in the United States in the 1980s and an international panel of 56 countries over the last several decades. Consistent with the importance of the household demand channel, we find that credit supply expansion boosts nontradable sector employment and the price of nontradable goods, with limited effects on tradable sector employment. Such credit expansions amplify the business cycle and lead to more severe recessions."
Shorting in Speculative Markets,MARCEL NUTZ,22 January 2020,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12871,"ABSTRACTIn models of trading with heterogeneous beliefs following Harrison-Kreps, short selling is prohibited and agents face constant marginal costs-of-carry. The resale option guarantees that prices exceed buy-and-hold prices and the difference is identified as a bubble. We propose a model where risk-neutral agents face asymmetric increasing marginal costs on long and short positions. Here, agents also value an option to delay, and a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation quantifies the influence of costs on prices. An unexpected decrease in shorting costs may deflate a bubble, linking financial innovations that facilitated shorting of mortgage-backed securities to the collapse of prices."
"Securitization, Ratings, and Credit Supply",BRENDAN DALEY,26 November 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12866,"ABSTRACTWe develop a framework to explore the effect of credit ratings on loan origination. We show that ratings endogenously shift the economy from asignalingequilibrium, in which banks inefficiently retain loans to signal quality, toward anoriginate-to-distributeequilibrium with zero retention and inefficiently low lending standards. Ratings increase overall efficiency, provided that the reduction in costly retention more than compensates for the origination of some negative net present value loans. We study how banks' ability to screen loans affects these predictions and use the model to analyze commonly proposed policies such as mandatory “skin in the game.”"
Glued to the TV: Distracted Noise Traders and Stock Market Liquidity,JOEL PERESS,18 November 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12863,"ABSTRACTIn this paper, we study the impact of noise traders’ limited attention on financial markets. Specifically, we exploit episodes of sensational news (exogenous to the market) that distract noise traders. We find that on “distraction days,” trading activity, liquidity, and volatility decrease, and prices reverse less among stocks owned predominantly by noise traders. These outcomes contrast sharply with those due to the inattention of informed speculators and market makers, and are consistent with noise traders mitigating adverse selection risk. We discuss the evolution of these outcomes over time and the role of technological changes."
Informed Trading and Intertemporal Substitution,YIZHOU XIAO,21 October 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12857,"ABSTRACTI examine the possibility of information-based trading in a multiperiod consumption setting. I develop a necessary and sufficient condition for trade to occur. Intertemporal substitution introduces a desire to correlate current consumption with future aggregate shocks. When agents have heterogeneous time-inseparable preferences, information differentially affects relative preferences for current and future consumption, making information-based trading mutually acceptable. The no-trade result continues to hold if there is no aggregate shock, or if agents have either homogeneous or time-separable preferences."

Trading Against the Random Expiration of Private Information: A Natural Experiment,MOHAMMADREZA BOLANDNAZAR,09 October 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12844,"ABSTRACTFor years, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) accidentally distributed securities disclosures to some investors before the public. We exploit this setting, which is unique because the delay until public disclosure was exogenous and the private information window was well defined, to study informed trading with a random stopping time. Trading intensity and the pace at which prices incorporate information decrease with the expected delay until public release, but the relation between trading intensity and time elapsed varies with traders' learning process. Noise trading and relative information advantage play similar roles as in standard microstructure theories assuming a fixed time window."
Access to Collateral and the Democratization of Credit: France's Reform of the Napoleonic Security Code,KEVIN ARETZ,09 October 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12846,"ABSTRACTFrance'sOrdonnance 2006-346repudiated the notion ofpossessory ownershipin the Napoleonic Code, easing the pledge of physical assets in a country where credit was highly concentrated. A differences-test strategy shows that firms operating newly pledgeable assets significantly increased their borrowing following the reform. Small, young, and financially constrained businesses benefitted the most, observing improved credit access and real-side outcomes. Start-ups emerged with higher “at-inception” leverage, located farther from large cities, with more assets-in-place than before. Their exit and bankruptcy rates declined. Spatial analyses show that the reform reached firms in rural areas, reducing credit access inequality across France's countryside."
Words Speak Louder without Actions,DORON LEVIT,12 July 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12834,"ABSTRACTInformation and control rights are central aspects of leadership, management, and corporate governance. This paper studies a principal-agent model that features both communication and intervention as alternative means to exert influence. The main result shows that a principal's power to intervene in an agent's decision limits the ability of the principal to effectively communicate her private information. The perverse effect of intervention on communication can harm the principal, especially when the cost of intervention is low or the underlying agency problem is severe. These novel results are applied to managerial leadership, corporate boards, private equity, and shareholder activism."
Learning from Coworkers: Peer Effects on Individual Investment Decisions,PAIGE OUIMET,30 June 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12830,"ABSTRACTUsing unique data on employee stock purchase plans (ESPPs), we examine the influence of networks on investment decisions. Comparing employees within a firm during the same election window with metro area fixed effects, we find that the choices of coworkers in the firm's ESPP exert a significant influence on employees’ own decisions to participate and trade. Moreover, we find that the presence of high-information employees magnifies the effects of peer networks. Given participation in an ESPP is value-maximizing, our analysis suggests the potential of networks and targeted investor education to improve financial decision-making."
Why Don't We Agree? Evidence from a Social Network of Investors,J. ANTHONY COOKSON,18 October 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12852,"ABSTRACTWe study sources of investor disagreement using sentiment of investors from a social media investing platform, combined with information on the users' investment approaches (e.g., technical, fundamental). We examine how much of overall disagreement is driven by different information sets versus differential interpretation of information by studying disagreement within and across investment approaches. Overall disagreement is evenly split between both sources of disagreement, but within-group disagreement is more tightly related to trading volume than cross-group disagreement. Although both sources of disagreement are important, our findings suggest that information differences are more important for trading than differences across market approaches."
The Impact of Salience on Investor Behavior: Evidence from a Natural Experiment,CARY FRYDMAN,21 October 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12851,"ABSTRACTWe test whether the display of information causally affects investor behavior in a high-stakes trading environment. Using investor-level brokerage data from China and a natural experiment, we estimate the impact of a shock that increased the salience of a stock's purchase price but did not change the investor's information set. We employ a difference-in-differences approach and find that the salience shock causally increased the disposition effect by 17%. We use microdata to document substantial heterogeneity across investors in the treatment effect. A previously documented trading pattern, the “rank effect,” explains heterogeneity in the change in the disposition effect."
Stimulating Housing Markets,DAVID BERGER,15 October 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12847,"ABSTRACTWe study temporary fiscal stimulus designed to support distressed housing markets by inducing demand from buyers in the private market. Using difference-in-differences and regression kink research designs, we find that the First-Time Homebuyer Credit increased home sales by 490,000 (9.8%), median home prices by $2,400 (1.1%) per standard deviation increase in program exposure, and the transition rate into homeownership by 53%. The policy response did not reverse immediately. Instead, demand comes from several years in the future: induced buyers were three years younger in 2009 than typical first-time buyers. The program's market-stabilizing benefits likely exceeded its direct stimulus effects."
Houses as ATMs: Mortgage Refinancing and Macroeconomic Uncertainty,HUI CHEN,08 October 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12842,"ABSTRACTMortgage refinancing activity associated with extraction of home equity contains a strongly countercyclical component consistent with household demand for liquidity. We estimate a structural model of liquidity management featuring countercyclical idiosyncratic labor income uncertainty, long- and short-term mortgages, and realistic borrowing constraints. We empirically evaluate its predictions for households' choices of leverage, liquid assets, and mortgage refinancing using microlevel data. Taking the observed historical paths of house prices, aggregate income, and interest rates as given, the model accounts for many salient features in the evolution of balance sheets and consumption in the cross-section of households over 2001 to 2012."
A Tale of Two Premiums: The Role of Hedgers and Speculators in Commodity Futures Markets,WENJIN KANG,12 October 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12845,"ABSTRACTThis paper studies the dynamic interaction between the net positions of traders and risk premiums in commodity futures markets. Short-term position changes are driven mainly by the liquidity demands of noncommercial traders, while long-term variation is driven primarily by the hedging demands of commercial traders. These two components influence expected futures returns with opposite signs. The gains from providing liquidity by commercials largely offset the premium they pay for obtaining price insurance."
"Pledgeability, Industry Liquidity, and Financing Cycles",DOUGLAS W. DIAMOND,04 July 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12831,"ABSTRACTWhy do firms choose high debt when they anticipate high valuations, and underperform subsequently? We propose a theory of financing cycles where the importance of creditors’ control rights over cash flows (“pledgeability”) varies with industry liquidity. The market allows firms take on more debt when they anticipate higher future liquidity. However, both high anticipated liquidity and the resulting high debt limit their incentives to enhance pledgeability. This has prolonged adverse effects in a downturn. Because these effects are hard to contract upon, higher anticipated liquidity can also reduce a firm's current access to finance."
The Insurance Is the Lemon: Failing to Index Contracts,BARNEY HARTMAN-GLASER,21 October 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12856,"ABSTRACTWe model the widespread failure of contracts to share risk using available indices. A borrower and lender can share risk by conditioning repayments on an index. The lender has private information about the ability of this index to measure the true state that the borrower would like to hedge. The lender is risk-averse and thus requires a premium to insure the borrower. The borrower, however, might be paying something for nothing if the index is a poor measure of the true state. We provide sufficient conditions for this effect to cause the borrower to choose a nonindexed contract instead."
Robust Inference for Consumption-Based Asset Pricing,FRANK KLEIBERGEN,20 October 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12855,"ABSTRACTThe reliability of traditional asset pricing tests depends on: (i) the correlations between asset returns and factors; (ii) the time series sample sizeTcompared to the number of assetsN. For macro-risk factors, like consumption growth, (i) and (ii) are often such that traditional tests cannot be trusted. We extend the Gibbons-Ross-Shanken statistic to test identification of risk premia and construct their 95% confidence sets. These sets are wide or unbounded whenTandNare close, but show that average returns are not fully spanned by betas whenTexceedsNconsiderably. Our findings indicate when meaningful empirical inference is feasible."
On Comparing Asset Pricing Models,SIDDHARTHA CHIB,20 October 2019,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12854,"ABSTRACTRevisiting the framework of (Barillas, Francisco, and Jay Shanken, 2018, Comparing asset pricing models,The Journal of Finance73, 715–754). BS henceforth, we show that the Bayesian marginal likelihood-based model comparison method in that paper is unsound : the priors on the nuisance parameters across models must satisfy a change of variable property for densities that is violated by the Jeffreys priors used in the BS method. Extensive simulation exercises confirm that the BS method performs unsatisfactorily. We derive a new class of improper priors on the nuisance parameters,starting from a single improper prior, which leads to valid marginal likelihoods and model comparisons. The performance of our marginal likelihoods is significantly better, allowing for reliable Bayesian work on which factors are risk factors in asset pricing models."

Do Intermediaries Matter for Aggregate Asset Prices?,VALENTIN HADDAD,04 October 2021,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13086,"ABSTRACTPoor financial health of intermediaries coincides with low asset prices and high risk premiums. Is this because intermediaries matter for asset prices, or because their health correlates with economy-wide risk aversion? In the first case, return predictability should be more pronounced for asset classes in which households are less active. We provide evidence supporting this prediction, suggesting that a quantitatively sizable fraction of risk premium variation in several large asset classes such as credit or mortgage-backed securities (MBS) is due to intermediaries. Movements in economy-wide risk aversion create the opposite pattern, and we find this channel also matters."
Currency Mispricing and Dealer Balance Sheets,GINO CENEDESE,14 September 2021,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13079,"ABSTRACTWe find dealer-level evidence that recent regulation on the leverage ratio requirement causes deviations from covered interest parity. Our analysis uses a unique data set of currency derivatives with disclosed counterparty identities together with exogenous variation introduced by the U.K. leverage ratio framework. Dealers who are affected by the regulatory shock charge an additional premium of about 20 basis points per annum for synthetic dollar funding relative to unaffected dealers. This finding holds even after controlling for changes in clients' demand. Also, some clients increase their trading activity with unaffected dealers with whom they already had a preexisting relationship."
Partisan Professionals: Evidence from Credit Rating Analysts,ELISABETH KEMPF,24 September 2021,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13083,"ABSTRACTPartisan perception affects the actions of professionals in the financial sector. Linking credit rating analysts to party affiliations from voter records, we show that analysts not affiliated with the U.S. president's party downward-adjust corporate credit ratings more frequently. Since we compare analysts with different party affiliations covering the same firm in the same quarter, differences in firm fundamentals cannot explain the results. We also find a sharp divergence in the rating actions of Democratic and Republican analysts around the 2016 presidential election. Our results show that analysts' partisan perception has price effects and may influence firms' investment policies."
"Inequality Aversion, Populism, and the Backlash against Globalization",ĽUBOŠ PÁSTOR,14 September 2021,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13081,"ABSTRACTMotivated by the recent rise of populism in Western democracies, we develop a tractable equilibrium model in which a populist backlash emerges endogenously in a strong economy. In the model, voters dislike inequality, especially the high consumption of “elites.” Economic growth exacerbates inequality due to heterogeneity in preferences , which leads to heterogeneity in returns on capital. In response to rising inequality, voters optimally elect a populist promising to end globalization. Equality is a luxury good. Countries with more inequality, higher financial development, and trade deficits are more vulnerable to populism, both in the model and in the data."
Talent in Distressed Firms: Investigating the Labor Costs of Financial Distress,RAMIN P. BAGHAI,13 September 2021,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13077,"ABSTRACTThe importance of skilled labor and the inalienability of human capital expose firms to the risk of losing talent at critical times. Using Swedish microdata, we document that firms lose workers with the highest cognitive and noncognitive skills as they approach bankruptcy. In a quasi-experiment, we confirm that financial distress drives these results: following a negative export shock caused by exogenous currency movements, talent abandons the firm, but only if the exporter is highly leveraged. Consistent with talent dependence being associated with higher labor costs of financial distress, firms that rely more on talent have more conservative capital structures."
Negative Home Equity and Household Labor Supply,ASAF BERNSTEIN,02 August 2021,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13070,"ABSTRACTUsing U.S. household-level data and plausibly exogenous variation in the location-timing of home purchases with a single lender, I find that negative home equity causes a 2% to 6% reduction in household labor supply. Supporting causality, households are observationally equivalent at origination and equally sensitive to local housing shocks that do not cause negative equity. Results also hold comparing purchases within the same year-metropolitan statistical area that differ by only a few months. Though multiple channels are likely at work, evidence of nonlinear effects is broadly consistent with costs associated with housing lock and financial distress."
Leverage Regulation and Market Structure: A Structural Model of the U.K. Mortgage Market,MATTEO BENETTON,04 August 2021,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13072,"ABSTRACTI develop a structural model of mortgage demand and lender competition to study how leverage regulation affects the U.K. mortgage market. Using variation in risk-weighted capital requirements across lenders and mortgages with different loan-to-values (LTVs), I show that a 1-percentage-point increase in risk-weighted capital requirements increases lenders' marginal cost of originating mortgages by about 26 basis points (11%) on average. I use the estimated model to study proposed leverage regulations. Counterfactual analyses show that large lenders exploit a regulatory cost advantage, which increases concentration by about 20%, and suggest that banning high-LTV mortgages may reduce large lenders' equity buffer."
Fire-Sale Spillovers in Debt Markets,ANTONIO FALATO,14 September 2021,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13078,"ABSTRACTFire sales induced by investor redemptions have powerful spillover effects among funds that hold the same assets, hurting peer funds' performance and flows, and leading to further asset sales with negative bond price impact. A one-standard-deviation increase in our fire-sale spillover measure leads to a 45 (90) bp decrease in peer fund returns (flows) and a two percentage point increase in the likelihood of a large bond price drop. The results hold in a regression-discontinuity design addressing identification concerns. Timing, heterogeneity, instrumental-variable, and placebo tests further support the price-impact mechanism. Model-based counterfactual and stress-test analyses quantify the financial stability implications."
Intermediation Variety,JASON RODERICK DONALDSON,02 October 2021,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13084,"ABSTRACTWe explain why banks and nonbank intermediaries coexist in a model based only on differences in their funding costs. Banks enjoy a low cost of capital due to safety nets and money-like liabilities. We show that this can actually be a disadvantage: it generates a soft-budget-constraint problem that makes it difficult for banks to credibly threaten to withhold additional funding to failed projects. Nonbanks emerge to solve this problem. Their high cost of capital is an advantage: it allows them to commit to terminate funding. Still, nonbanks never take over the entire market, but other coexist with banks in equilibrium."
Asset Pricing and Sports Betting,TOBIAS J. MOSKOWITZ,21 September 2021,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13082,"ABSTRACTSports betting markets offer a novel laboratory to test theories of cross-sectional asset pricing anomalies. Two features of this market—no systematic risk and terminal values exogenous to betting activity—evade the joint hypothesis problem, allowing mispricing to be detected. Examining a large and diverse set of liquid betting contracts, I find strong evidence of momentum, consistent with delayed overreaction and inconsistent with underreaction and rational pricing. Returns are a fraction of those in financial markets and fail to overcome transactions costs, preventing arbitrage from eliminating them. An insight from betting also predicts value and momentum returns in U.S. equities."
"Volatility, Valuation Ratios, and Bubbles: An Empirical Measure of Market Sentiment",CAN GAO,13 July 2021,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13068,"ABSTRACTWe define a sentiment indicator based on option prices, valuation ratios, and interest rates. The indicator can be interpreted as a lower bound on the expected growth in fundamentals that a rational investor would have to perceive to be happy to hold the market. The bound was unusually high in the late 1990s, reflecting dividend growth expectations that in our view were unreasonably optimistic. Our approach exploits two key ingredients. First, we derive a new valuation ratio decomposition that is related to the Campbell–Shiller loglinearization but that resembles the Gordon growth model more closely and has certain other advantages. Second, we introduce a volatility index that provides a lower bound on the market's expected log return."
Valuing Private Equity Investments Strip by Strip,ARPIT GUPTA,09 August 2021,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13073,"ABSTRACTWe propose a new valuation method for private equity (PE) investments. It constructs a replicating portfolio using cash flows on listed equity and fixed-income instruments (strips). It then values the strips using an asset pricing model that captures the risk in the cross-section of bonds and equity factors. The method delivers a risk-adjusted profit on each PE investment and a time series for the expected return on each fund category. We find negative risk-adjusted profits for the average PE fund, with substantial heterogeneity and some persistence in the performance. Expected returns and risk-adjusted profit decline in the later part of the sample."
Real Estate Shocks and Financial Advisor Misconduct,STEPHEN G. DIMMOCK,13 July 2021,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13067,"ABSTRACTWe test whether personal real estate shocks affect professional misconduct by financial advisors. We use a panel of advisors' home addresses and examine within-advisor variation relative to other advisors who work at the same firm and live in the same ZIP code. We find a negative relation between housing returns and misconduct. We show that advisors' housing returns explain misconduct against out-of-state customers, breaking the link between customer and advisor housing shocks. Furthermore, the results are stronger for advisors with lower career risk from committing misconduct, and for advisors with greater borrowing constraints."
Economic Stimulus at the Expense of Routine-Task Jobs,SELALE TUZEL,14 September 2021,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13080,"ABSTRACTDo investment tax incentives improve job prospects for workers? We explore states' adoption of a major federal tax incentive that accelerates the depreciation of equipment investments for eligible firms but not for ineligible ones. Analyzing massive establishment-level data sets on occupational employment and computer investment, we find that when states expand investment incentives, eligible firms immediately increase their equipment and skilled employees; whereas they reduce routine-task employees after a delay of up to two years. These opposing effects constitute an overall insignificant effect on the firms' total employment and shed light on the nuances of job creation through investment incentives."
"Information Asymmetry, Mispricing, and Security Issuance",JIYOON LEE,12 July 2021,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13066,"ABSTRACTI examine the effects of information asymmetry–driven mispricing on security issuance. Using predisclosure changes in purchase obligations as a proxy for information asymmetry–driven mispricing, I find that managers avoid (prefer) issuing securities when they perceive their firms to be undervalued (overvalued). The effects of information asymmetry–driven mispricing are stronger on equity issuance than debt issuance. Consequently, undervaluation (overvaluation) causes an increase (decrease) in leverage. These effects are more pronounced for firms, periods, and securities associated with greater information asymmetry. The stock-trading patterns that managers follow suggest that their perceived mispricing is an important factor in both private and firm-level decisions."

The Cross Section of MBS Returns,PETER DIEP,15 June 2021,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13055,"ABSTRACTWe present a simple, linear asset pricing model of the cross section of Mortgage-Backed Security (MBS) returns. MBS earn risk premia as compensation for their exposure to prepayment risk. We measure prepayment risk and estimate risk loadings using prepayment forecasts versus realizations. Estimated loadings on prepayment risk decrease monotonically in securities' coupons relative to the par coupon, consistent with the predicted effect of prepayment on bond value. Prepayment risk appears to be priced by specialized MBS investors. The price of prepayment risk changes sign over time with the sign of a representative MBS investor's exposure to prepayment shocks."
Reinvestment Risk and the Equity Term Structure,ANDREI S. GONÇALVES,27 April 2021,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13035,"ABSTRACTThe equity term structure is downward sloping at long maturities. I estimate an Intertemporal Capital Asset Pricing Model (ICAPM) to show that the trade-off between market and reinvestment risk explains this pattern. Intuitively, while long-term dividend claims are highly exposed to market risk, they are good hedges for reinvestment risk because dividend prices rise as expected returns decline, and longer-term claims are more sensitive to discount rates. In the estimated ICAPM, reinvestment risk dominates at long maturities, inducing relatively low risk premia on long-term dividend claims. The model is also consistent with the equity term structure cyclicality and the upward-sloping bond term structure."
"Inventory Management, Dealers' Connections, and Prices in Over-the-Counter Markets",JEAN-EDOUARD COLLIARD,28 April 2021,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13034,"ABSTRACTWe propose a new model of trading in over-the-counter markets. Dealers accumulate inventories by trading with end-investors and trade among each other to reduce their inventory holding costs. Core dealers use a more efficient trading technology than peripheral dealers, who are heterogeneously connected to core dealers and trade with each other bilaterally. Connectedness affects prices and allocations if and only if the peripheral dealers' aggregate inventory position differs from zero. Price dispersion increases in the size of this position. The model generates new predictions about the effects of dealers' connectedness and dealers' aggregate inventories on prices."
Tracking Retail Investor Activity,EKKEHART BOEHMER,28 April 2021,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13033,"ABSTRACTWe provide an easy method to identify marketable retail purchases and sales using recent, publicly available U.S. equity transactions data. Individual stocks with net buying by retail investors outperform stocks with negative imbalances by approximately 10 bps over the following week. Less than half of the predictive power of marketable retail order imbalance is attributable to order flow persistence, while the rest cannot be explained by contrarian trading (proxy for liquidity provision) or public news sentiment. There is suggestive, but only suggestive, evidence that retail marketable orders might contain firm-level information that is not yet incorporated into prices."
Can the Market Multiply and Divide? Non-Proportional Thinking in Financial Markets,KELLY SHUE,28 May 2021,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13059,"ABSTRACTWe hypothesize that investors partially think about stock price changes in dollar rather than percentage units, leading to more extreme return responses to news for lower-priced stocks. Consistent with such non-proportional thinking, we find a doubling in price is associated with a 20% to 30% decline in volatility and beta (controlling for size/liquidity). To identify a causal price effect, we show that volatility jumps following stock splits and drops following reverse splits. Lower-priced stocks also respond more strongly to firm-specific news. Non-proportional thinking helps explain asset pricing patterns such as the size-volatility/beta relation, the leverage effect puzzle, and return drift and reversals."
The Misallocation of Finance,TONI M. WHITED,28 April 2021,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13031,"ABSTRACTWe estimate real losses arising from the cross-sectional misallocation of financial liabilities. Extending a production-based framework of misallocation measurement to the liabilities side of the balance sheet and using manufacturing firm data from the United States and China, we find significant misallocation of debt and equity in China but not the United States. Reallocating liabilities of firms in China to mimic U.S. efficiency would produce gains of 51% to 69% in real value-added, with only 17% to 21% stemming from inefficient debt-equity combinations. For Chinese firms that are large or in developed cities, we estimate lower distortionary financing costs."
Property Rights to Client Relationships and Financial Advisor Incentives,CHRISTOPHER P. CLIFFORD,22 May 2021,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13058,"ABSTRACTWe study the effect of a change in property rights on employee behavior in the financial advice industry. Our identification comes from staggered firm-level entry into theProtocol for Broker Recruiting, which waived nonsolicitation clauses for advisor transitions among member firms, effectively transferring ownership of client relationships from the firm to the advisor. After the shock, advisors appear to tend to client relationships more by investing in client-facing industry licenses, shifting to fee-based advising, and reducing customer complaints. Our findings support property rights based investment theories of the firm and document offsetting costs to restricting labor mobility."
The Limits of p-Hacking: Some Thought Experiments,ANDREW Y.

How muchp-hacking is required to produce these factors? If 10,000 researchers generate eight factors every day, it takes hundreds of years. This is because dozens of publishedt-statistics exceed 6.0, while the correspondingp-value is infinitesimal, implying an astronomical amount ofp-hacking in a general model. More structure implies thatp-hacking cannot address100 publishedt-statistics that exceed 4.0, as they require an implausibly nonlinear preference fort-statistics or even morep-hacking.

Do Physiological and Spiritual Factors Affect Economic Decisions?,CEM DEMIROGLU,28 April 2021,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13032,"ABSTRACTWe examine the effects of physiology and spiritual sentiment on economic decision-making in the context of Ramadan, an entire lunar month of daily fasting and increased spiritual reflection in the Muslim faith. Using an administrative data set of bank loans originated in Turkey during 2003 to 2013, we find that small business loans originated during Ramadan are 15% more likely to default within two years of origination. Loans originated in hot Ramadans, when adverse physiological effects of fasting are greatest, and those approved by the busiest bank branches perform worse.

CAMPBELL,24 May 2021,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13056,"ABSTRACTWe study mortgage design features aimed at stabilizing the macroeconomy. We model overlapping generations of borrowers and an infinitely lived risk-averse representative lender. Mortgages are priced using an equilibrium pricing kernel derived from the lender's endogenous consumption. We consider an adjustable-rate mortgage with an option that during recessions allows borrowers to pay only interest on their loan and extend its maturity. The option stabilizes consumption growth over the business cycle, shifts defaults to expansions, and enhances welfare. The cyclical properties of the contract are attractive to a risk-averse lender so that the mortgage can be provided at a relatively low cost."
Out-of-Town Home Buyers and City Welfare,JACK FAVILUKIS,22 May 2021,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13057,"ABSTRACTMany cities have attracted a flurry of out-of-town (OOT) home buyers. Such capital inflows affect house prices, rents, construction, labor income, wealth, and ultimately welfare. We develop an equilibrium model to quantify the welfare effects of OOT home buyers for the typical U.S. metropolitan area. When OOT investors buy 10% of the housing in the city center and 5% in the suburbs, welfare among residents falls by 0.61% in consumption-equivalent units. House prices and rents rise substantially, resulting in welfare gains for owners and losses for renters. Policies that tax OOT buyers or mandate renting out vacant property mitigate welfare losses."
Prospect Theory and Stock Market Anomalies,NICHOLAS BARBERIS,05 June 2021,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13061,"ABSTRACTWe present a new model of asset prices in which investors evaluate risk according to prospect theory and examine its ability to explain 23 prominent stock market anomalies. The model incorporates all of the elements of prospect theory, accounts for investors' prior gains and losses, and makes quantitative predictions about an asset's average return based on empirical estimates of the asset's return volatility, return skewness, and past capital gain. We find that the model can help explain a majority of the 23 anomalies."
Risk Management in Financial Institutions: A Replication,PAUL M. GUEST,05 July 2021,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13063,"ABSTRACTRampini, Viswanathan, and Vuillemey (RVV) show empirically that net worth drives hedging. I identify discrepancies to which RVV's key findings are not robust: the positive correlation between net worth and hedging is not independent of institution size, house price decline shocks to net worth (which RVV use for identification) have mixed effects on hedging that are not robust across alternative specifications, and the treatment effects on net worth and hedging are not increasing in real estate exposure, inconsistent with a causal explanation. Overall, my analysis does not support the conclusion of RVV that higher net worth causes more hedging."
Presidential Address: How Much “Rationality” Is There in Bond-Market Risk Premiums?,KENNETH J. SINGLETON,09 June 2021,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13062,"ABSTRACTBeliefs of professional forecasters are benchmarked against those of a Bayesian econometricianBEwho is learning about the unknown dynamics of the bond risk factors. Consistent with rational Bayesian learning, the forecast errors of individual professionals andare comparably predictable over the business cycle. The secular and cyclical patterns of professionals' forecasts relative to those ofare explored in depth. Inconsistent with many models with belief dispersion, the relationship between professionals' yield disagreement and theirmatcheddisagreements about macroeconomic fundamentals is very weak."
What Explains Differences in Finance Research Productivity during the Pandemic?,BRAD M. BARBER,13 April 2021,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13028,"ABSTRACTBased on a survey of American Finance Association members, we analyze how demographics, time allocation, production mechanisms, and institutional factors affect research production during the pandemic. Consistent with the literature, research productivity falls more for women and faculty with young children. Independently, and novel, extra time spent on teaching (much more likely for women) negatively affects research productivity. Also novel, concerns about feedback, isolation, and health have large negative research effects, which disproportionately affect junior faculty and PhD students. Finally, faculty who express greater concerns about employers’ finances report larger negative research effects and more concerns about feedback, isolation, and health."
Don't Take Their Word for It: The Misclassification of Bond Mutual Funds,HUAIZHI CHEN,09 April 2021,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13023,"ABSTRACTWe provide evidence that bond fund managers misclassify their holdings, and that these misclassifications have a real and significant impact on investor capital flows. The problem is widespread, resulting in up to 31.4% of funds being misclassified with safer profiles, compared to their true, publicly reported holdings. “Misclassified funds”—those that hold risky bonds but claim to hold safer bonds—appear to on-average outperform lower risk funds in their peer groups. Within category groups, misclassified funds receive more Morningstar stars and higher investor flows. However, when we correctly classify them based on actual risk, these funds are mediocre performers."
Weathering Cash Flow Shocks,JAMES R. BROWN,15 April 2021,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13024,"ABSTRACTUnexpectedly severe winter weather, which is arguably exogenous to firm and bank fundamentals, represents a significant cash flow shock for bank-borrowing firms. Firms respond to these shocks by drawing on and increasing the size of their credit lines. Banks charge borrowers for this liquidity via increased interest rates and less borrower-friendly loan provisions. Credit line adjustments occur within one calendar quarter of the shock and persist for at least nine months. Overall, we provide evidence that bank credit lines are an important tool for managing the nonfundamental component of cash flow volatility, especially for solvent, small bank borrowers."
Are CEOs Different?,STEVEN N. KAPLAN,09 March 2021,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13019,"ABSTRACTUsing 2,603 executive assessments, we study how CEO candidates differ from candidates for other top management positions, particularly CFOs. More than half of the variation in the 30 assessed characteristics is explained by four factors that we interpret as general ability, execution (vs. interpersonal), charisma (vs. analytical), and strategic (vs. managerial). CEO candidates have more extreme factor scores that differ significantly from those of CFO candidates. Conditional on being considered, candidates with greater general ability and interpersonal skills are more likely to be hired. These and our previous results on CEO success suggest that boards overweight interpersonal skills in hiring CEOs."
A Theory of Zombie Lending,YUNZHI HU,06 April 2021,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13022,"ABSTRACTAn entrepreneur borrows from a relationship bank or the market. The bank has a higher cost of capital but produces private information over time. While the entrepreneur accumulates reputation as the lending relationship continues, asymmetric information is also developed between the bank/entrepreneur and the market. In this setting, zombie lending is inevitable: Once the entrepreneur becomes sufficiently reputable, the bank will roll over loans even after learning bad news, for the prospect of future market financing. Zombie lending is mitigated when the entrepreneur faces financial constraints. Finally, the bank stops producing information too early if information production is costly."
Rent Extraction with Securities Plus Cash,TINGJUN LIU,16 March 2021,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13018,"ABSTRACTIn our target-initiated theory of takeovers, a target approaches potential acquirers that privately know their standalone values and merger synergies, where higher synergy acquirers tend to have larger standalone values. Despite their information disadvantage, targets can extract all surplus when synergies and standalone values are concavely related by offering payment choices that are combinations of cash and equity. Targets exploit the reluctance of high-valuation acquirers to cede equity claims, inducing them to bid more cash. When synergies and standalone values are not concavely related, sellers can gain by combining cash with securities that are more information sensitive than equities."
How Debit Cards Enable the Poor to Save More,PIERRE BACHAS,29 March 2021,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13021,"ABSTRACTWe study an at-scale natural experiment in which debit cards were given to cash transfer recipients who already had a bank account. Using administrative account data and household surveys, we find that beneficiaries accumulated a savings stock equal to 2% of annual income after two years with the card. The increase in formal savings represents an increase in overall savings, financed by a reduction in current consumption. There are two mechanisms. First, debit cards reduce transaction costs of accessing money. Second, they reduce monitoring costs, which led beneficiaries to check their account balances frequently and build trust in the bank."
Time Variation of the Equity Term Structure,NIELS JOACHIM GORMSEN,30 March 2021,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13020,"ABSTRACTI study the term structure of one-period expected returns on dividend claims with different maturity. I find that the slope of the term structure is countercyclical. The countercyclical variation is consistent with theories of long-run risk and habit, but these theories cannot explain the average downward slope. At the same time, the cyclical variation is inconsistent with recent models constructed to match the average downward slope. More generally, the average and cyclicality of the slope are hard to reconcile with models with a single risk factor. I introduce a model with two priced factors to solve the puzzle."
Sentiment Trading and Hedge Fund Returns,YONG CHEN,08 April 2021,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13025,"ABSTRACTIn the presence of sentiment fluctuations, arbitrageurs may engage in different strategies leading to dispersed sentiment exposures. We find that hedge funds in the top decile ranked by sentiment beta outperform those in the bottom decile by 0.59% per month on a risk-adjusted basis, with the spread being larger among skilled funds. We also find that about 10% of hedge funds have sentiment timing skill that positively correlates with fund sentiment beta and contributes to fund performance. Our findings show that skilled hedge funds can earn high returns by predicting and exploiting sentiment changes rather than betting against mispricing."
Asset Managers: Institutional Performance and Factor Exposures,JOSEPH GERAKOS,15 April 2021,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13026,"ABSTRACTUsing data on $18 trillion of assets under management, we show that actively managed institutional accounts outperformed strategy benchmarks by 75 (31) bps on a gross (net) basis during the period 2000 to 2012. Estimates from a Sharpe model imply that asset managers' outperformance came from factor exposures. If institutions had instead implemented mean-variance efficient portfolios using index and institutional mutual funds available during the sample period, they would not have earned higher Sharpe ratios. Our results are consistent with the average asset manager having skill, managers competing for institutional capital, and institutions engaging in costly search to identify skilled managers."
Foreign Safe Asset Demand and the Dollar Exchange Rate,ZHENGYANG JIANG,02 February 2021,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13003,"ABSTRACTWe develop a theory that links the U.S. dollar's valuation in FX markets to the convenience yield that foreign investors derive from holding U.S. safe assets. We show that this convenience yield can be inferred from the Treasury basis, the yield gap between U.S. government and currency-hedged foreign government bonds. Consistent with the theory, a widening of the basis coincides with an immediate appreciation and a subsequent depreciation of the dollar. Our results lend empirical support to models that impute a special role to the United States as the world's provider of safe assets and the dollar as the world's reserve currency."
Banking on Deposits: Maturity Transformation without Interest Rate Risk,ITAMAR DRECHSLER,15 February 2021,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13013,"ABSTRACTWe show that maturity transformation does not expose banks to interest rate risk—it hedges it. The reason is the deposit franchise, which allows banks to pay deposit rates that are low and insensitive to market interest rates. Hedging the deposit franchise requires banks to earn income that is also insensitive, that is, to lend long term at fixed rates. As predicted by this theory, we show that banks closely match the interest rate sensitivities of their interest income and expense, and that this insulates their equity from interest rate shocks. Our results explain why banks supply long-term credit."
Monetary Policy and Reaching for Income,KENT DANIEL,01 February 2021,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13004,"ABSTRACTUsing data on individual portfolio holdings and on mutual fund flows, we find that low interest rates lead to significantly higher demand for income-generating assets such as high-dividend stocks and high-yield bonds. We argue that this “reaching-for-income” phenomenon is driven by investors who follow the “living off income” rule-of-thumb. Our empirical analysis shows that this preference for current income affects both household portfolio choices and the prices of income-generating assets. In addition, we explore the implications of reaching for income for capital allocation and the effectiveness of monetary policy."
Leverage Dynamics without Commitment,PETER M. DEMARZO,22 December 2020,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13001,"ABSTRACTWe characterize equilibrium leverage dynamics in a trade-off model in which the firm can continuously adjust leverage and cannot commit to a policy ex ante. While the leverage ratchet effect leads shareholders to issue debt gradually over time, asset growth and debt maturity cause leverage to mean-revert slowly toward a target. Investors anticipate future debt issuance and raise credit spreads, fully offsetting the tax benefits of new debt. Shareholders are therefore indifferent toward the debt maturity structure, even though their choice significantly affects credit spreads, leverage levels, the speed of adjustment, future investment, and growth."
Fire-Sale Spillovers and Systemic Risk,FERNANDO DUARTE,11 February 2021,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13010,"ABSTRACTWe identify and track over time the factors that make the financial system vulnerable to fire sales by constructing an index of aggregate vulnerability. The index starts increasing quickly in 2004, before most other major systemic risk measures, and triples by 2008. The fire-sale-specific factors of delevering speed and concentration of illiquid assets account for the majority of this increase. Individual banks' contributions to aggregate vulnerability predict other firm-specific measures of systemic risk, including SRISK andΔCoVaR. The balance-sheet-based measures we propose are therefore useful early indicators of when and where vulnerabilities are building up."
Leveraged Funds and the Shadow Cost of Leverage Constraints,ZHONGJIN LU,11 February 2021,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13012,"ABSTRACTUsing the most comprehensive data set of leveraged funds known to the literature, we measure the market-wide shadow cost of leverage constraints and examine its pricing implications. The shadow cost averages 0.53% per annum from 2006 to 2016, spikes upon quarter-ends when banks face tighter capital requirements, positively predicts future betting-against-beta (BAB) returns, and negatively correlates with contemporaneous BAB returns. Stocks that experience lower returns when the shadow cost increases earn 0.85% more per month. Overall, our shadow cost measure fits the predictions of leverage-constraint-based theories better than the widely used TED spread."
Subjective Cash Flow and Discount Rate Expectations,RICARDO DELAO,26 February 2021,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13016,"ABSTRACTWhy do stock prices vary? Using survey forecasts, we find that cash flow growth expectations explain most movements in the S&P 500 price-dividend and price-earnings ratios, accounting for at least 93% and 63% of their variation. These expectations comove strongly with price ratios, even when price ratios do not predict future cash flow growth. In comparison, return expectations have low volatility and small comovement with price ratios. Short-term, rather than long-term, expectations account for most price ratio variation. We propose an asset pricing model with beliefs about earnings growth reversal that accurately replicates these cash flow growth expectations and dynamics."
Who Wears the Pants? Gender Identity Norms and Intrahousehold Financial Decision-Making,DA KE,02 February 2021,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13002,"ABSTRACTUsing microdata from U.S. household surveys, I document that families with a financially sophisticated husband are more likely to participate in the stock market than those with a wife of equal financial sophistication. This pattern is best explained by gender identity norms, which constrain women's influence over intrahousehold financial decision-making. A randomized controlled experiment reveals that female identity hinders idea contribution by the wife. These findings underscore the roles of intrahousehold bargaining and traditional norms in shaping household financial decisions."
The Economics of Hedge Fund Startups: Theory and Empirical Evidence,CHARLES CAO,05 February 2021,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13009,"ABSTRACTThis paper examines how market frictions influence the managerial incentives and organizational structure of new hedge funds. We develop a stylized model in which new managers search for accredited investors and have stronger incentives to acquire managerial skill when encountering low investor demand. Fund families endogenously arise to mitigate frictions and weaken the performance incentives of affiliated new funds. Empirically, based on a TASS-HFR-BarclayHedge merged database, we find that ex ante identified cold inceptions facing low investor demand outperform existing hedge funds and hot inceptions facing high demand and that cold stand-alone inceptions outperform all types of family-affiliated inceptions."
Trading Costs and Informational Efficiency,EDUARDO DÁVILA,10 February 2021,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13008,"ABSTRACTWe study the effect of trading costs on information aggregation and acquisition in financial markets. For a given precision of investors' private information, an irrelevance result emerges when investors are ex ante identical: price informativeness is independent of the level of trading costs. When investors are ex ante heterogeneous, a change in trading costs can increase or decrease price informativeness, depending on the source of heterogeneity. Our results are valid under quadratic, linear, and fixed costs. Through a reduction in information acquisition, trading costs reduce price informativeness. We discuss how our results inform the policy debate on financial transaction taxes/Tobin taxes."
"For Richer, for Poorer: Bankers' Liability and Bank Risk in New England, 1867 to 1880",PETER KOUDIJS,11 February 2021,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13011,"ABSTRACTWe study whether banks are riskier if managers have less liability. We focus on New England between 1867 and 1880 and consider the introduction of marital property laws that limited liability for newly wedded bankers. We find that banks with managers who married after a law had higher leverage, delayed loss recognition, made more risky and fraudulent loans, and lost more capital and deposits in the Long Depression of 1873 to 1878. These effects were most pronounced for bankers with the largest reduction in liability. We find no evidence that limiting liability increased firm investment at the county level."
The Private Production of Safe Assets,MARCIN KACPERCZYK,07 December 2020,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12997,"ABSTRACTUsing high-frequency, granular panel data on short-term debt securities issued in Europe, we study the existence, empirical boundaries, and fragility of private assets' safety. We show that only securities with the shortest maturities, issued by banks (certificates of deposit, or CDs), benefit from a safety premium. The supply of such CDs responds positively to excess safety demand. During periods of stress, this relation vanishes for all issuers of private securities, even though their aggregate volumes do not collapse. Other dimensions of heterogeneity, including issuers' balance sheets or their domicile countries' fiscal capacity, are less relevant for private safety."
"Mutual Fund Holdings of Credit Default Swaps: Liquidity, Yield, and Risk",WEI JIANG,04 December 2020,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12996,"ABSTRACTThis study analyzes the motivations for and consequences of funds' credit default swap (CDS) investments using mutual funds' quarterly holdings from pre- to postfinancial crisis. Funds invest in CDS when facing unpredictable liquidity needs. Funds sell more in reference entities when the CDS is liquid relative to the underlying bonds and buy more when the CDS-bond basis is more negative. To enhance yield, funds engage in negative basis trading and sell CDS with the highest spreads within rating categories, and with spreads higher than those of their bond portfolios. Funds with superior portfolio returns also demonstrate more skill in CDS trading."
The Misguided Beliefs of Financial Advisors,JUHANI T. LINNAINMAA,28 November 2020,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12995,"ABSTRACTA common view of retail finance is that conflicts of interest contribute to the high cost of advice. Within a large sample of Canadian financial advisors and their clients, however, we show that advisors typically invest personally just as they advise their clients. Advisors trade frequently, chase returns, prefer expensive and actively managed funds, and underdiversify. Advisors' net returns of −3% per year are similar to their clients' net returns. Advisors do not strategically hold expensive portfolios only to convince clients to do the same; they continue to do so after they leave the industry."
The Impact of Repossession Risk on Mortgage Default,TERRY O'MALLEY,12 November 2020,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12990,"ABSTRACTI study the effect of removing repossession risk on a mortgagor's decision to default. Reducing default costs may result in strategic default, particularly during crises when homeowners can be substantially underwater. I analyze difference-in-differences variation in repossession risk generated by an unexpected legal ruling in Ireland that prohibited collateral enforcement on delinquent residential mortgages originated before a particular date. I estimate that borrowers defaulted by 0.3 percentage points more each quarter after the ruling, a relative increase of approximately one-half. High loan-to-value ratios and low liquidity are associated with a larger treatment effect, suggesting both equity and consumption-based motivations."
Financial Fragility with SAM?,DANIEL L. GREENWALD,03 December 2020,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12992,"ABSTRACTShared appreciation mortgages (SAMs) feature mortgage payments that adjust with house prices. They are designed to stave off borrower default by providing payment relief when house prices fall. Some argue that SAMs may help prevent the next foreclosure crisis. However, home owners' gains from payment relief are mortgage lenders' losses. A general equilibrium model in which financial intermediaries channel savings from saver to borrower households shows that indexation of mortgage payments to aggregate house prices increases financial fragility, reduces risk-sharing, and leads to expensive financial sector bailouts. In contrast, indexation to local house prices reduces financial fragility and improves risk-sharing."
Anonymous Trading in Equities,TOM GRIMSTVEDT MELING,12 November 2020,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12988,"ABSTRACTIn this paper, I explore a reform at the Oslo Stock Exchange to assess the causal effect of posttrade trader anonymity on stock liquidity and trading volume. Using a regression discontinuity approach, I find that anonymity leads to a reduction in bid-ask spreads of 40% and an increase in trading volume of more than 50%. The increase in trading volume is accounted for largely by increased trading activity by institutional investors, while retail investors do not adjust their trading behavior in response to anonymity. The results suggest that posttrade anonymity positively affects standard measures of market quality."
Liquidity Supply in the Corporate Bond Market,JONATHAN GOLDBERG,10 November 2020,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12991,"ABSTRACTThis paper examines dealer inventory capacity, or liquidity supply, as a driver of liquidity and expected returns in the corporate bond market. We identify shocks to aggregate liquidity supply using data on corporate bond yields and dealer positions. Liquidity supply shocks lead to persistent changes in market liquidity, are correlated with proxies for dealer financial constraints, and have significant explanatory power for cross-sectional and time-series variation in expected returns, beyond standard risk factors. Our findings point to liquidity supply by financially constrained intermediaries as a main driver of market liquidity and asset prices."
"The Perception of Dependence, Investment Decisions, and Stock Prices",MICHAEL UNGEHEUER,24 November 2020,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12993,"ABSTRACTHow do investors perceive dependence between stock returns; and how does their perception of dependence affect investments and stock prices? We show experimentally that investors understand differences in dependence, but not in terms of correlation. Participants invest as if applying a simple counting heuristic for the frequency of comovement. They diversify more when the frequency of comovement is lower even if correlation is higher due to dependence in the tails. Building on our experimental findings, we empirically analyze U.S. stock returns. We identify a robust return premium for stocks with high frequencies of comovement with the market return."
"Public Thrift, Private Perks: Signaling Board Independence with Executive Pay",PABLO RUIZ-VERDÚ,12 November 2020,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12989,"ABSTRACTWe analyze how boards' reputational concerns influence executive compensation and the use of hidden pay. Independent boards reduce disclosed pay to signal their independence, but are more likely than manager-friendly boards to use hidden pay or to distort incentive contracts. Stronger reputational pressures lead to lower disclosed pay, weaker managerial incentives, and higher hidden pay, whereas greater transparency of executive compensation has the opposite effects. Although reputational concerns can induce boards to choose compensation contracts more favorable to shareholders, we show that there is a threshold beyond which stronger reputational concerns harm shareholders. Similarly, excessive pay transparency can harm shareholders."
Limited Risk Sharing and International Equity Returns,SHAOJUN ZHANG,24 November 2020,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12994,"ABSTRACTLimited stock market participation can potentially explain the disconnect between international asset prices and macro quantities. An incomplete markets model in which risk sharing for stockholders is high generates highly correlated equity returns and relatively smooth exchange rates. Risk sharing for nonstockholders is limited because of their nonparticipation in stock markets and borrowing constraints, reducing the aggregate consumption correlation and the correlation between aggregate consumption differentials and exchange rates. Financial integration widens the disconnect by benefiting stockholders but hurting nonstockholders. Survey data indicate that international risk sharing for stockholders is better than that for nonstockholders, consistent with the predictions."
Model-Free International Stochastic Discount Factors,MIRELA SANDULESCU,31 July 2020,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12970,"ABSTRACTWe provide a theoretical framework to uncover in a model-free way the relationships among international stochastic discount factors (SDFs), stochastic wedges, and financial market structures. Exchange rates are in general different from the ratio of international SDFs in incomplete markets, as captured by a stochastic wedge. We show theoretically that this wedge can be zero in incomplete and integrated markets. Market segmentation breaks the strong link between exchange rates and international SDFs, which helps address salient features of international asset returns while keeping the volatility and cross-country correlation of SDFs at moderate levels."
Equilibrium Asset Pricing with Leverage and Default,JOÃO F. GOMES,09 November 2020,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12987,"ABSTRACTWe develop a general equilibrium model linking the pricing of stocks and corporate bonds to endogenous movements in corporate leverage and aggregate volatility. The model features heterogeneous firms making optimal investment and financing decisions and connects fluctuations in macroeconomic quantities and asset prices to movements in the cross section of firms. Empirically plausible movements in leverage produce realistic asset return dynamics. Countercyclical leverage drives predictable variation in risk premia, and debt-financed growth generates a high value premium. Endogenous default produces countercyclical aggregate volatility and credit spread movements that are propagated to the real economy through their effects on investment and output."
Report of the Editor of The Journal of Finance for the Year 2020,STEFAN NAGEL,04 March 2021,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13015,
The Limits of Limited Liability: Evidence from Industrial Pollution,PAT AKEY,24 September 2020,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12978,"ABSTRACTWe study how parent liability for subsidiaries' environmental cleanup costs affects industrial pollution and production. Our empirical setting exploits a Supreme Court decision that strengthened parent limited liability protection for some subsidiaries. Using a difference-in-differences framework, we find that stronger liability protection for parents leads to a 5% to 9% increase in toxic emissions by subsidiaries. Evidence suggests the increase in pollution is driven by lower investment in abatement technologies rather than increased production. Cross-sectional tests suggest convexities associated with insolvency and executive compensation drive heterogeneous effects. Overall, our findings highlight the moral hazard problem associated with limited liability."
Do Household Wealth Shocks Affect Productivity? Evidence from Innovative Workers During the Great Recession,SHAI BERNSTEIN,24 September 2020,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12976,"ABSTRACTWe investigate how the deterioration of household balance sheets affects worker productivity, and in turn economic downturns. Specifically, we compare the output of innovative workers who experienced differential declines in housing wealth during the financial crisis but were employed at the same firm and lived in the same metropolitan area. We find that, following a negative wealth shock, innovative workers become less productive and generate lower economic value for their firms. The reduction in innovative output is not driven by workers switching to less innovative firms or positions. These effects are more pronounced among workers at greater risk of financial distress."
Mortgage Design in an Equilibrium Model of the Housing Market,ADAM M. GUREN,14 July 2020,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12963,"ABSTRACTHow can mortgages be redesigned to reduce macrovolatility and default? We address this question using a quantitative equilibrium life-cycle model. Designs with countercyclical payments outperform fixed payments. Among those, designs that front-load payment reductions in recessions outperform those that spread relief over the full term. Front-loading alleviates liquidity constraints when they bind most, reducing default and stimulating housing demand. To illustrate, a fixed-rate mortgage (FRM) with an option to convert to adjustable-rate mortgage, which front-loads payment reductions relative to an FRM with an option to refinance underwater, reduces price and consumption declines six times as much and default three times as much."
The Capitalization of Consumer Financing into Durable Goods Prices,BRONSON ARGYLE,24 September 2020,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12977,"ABSTRACTUsing loan-level data on millions of used-car transactions across hundreds of lenders, we study the consumer response to exogenous variation in credit terms. Borrowers offered shorter maturity decrease expenditures enough to offset 60% to 90% of the monthly payment increase. Most of this is driven by shifting toward lower-quality cars, but affected borrowers offset 20% to 30% of a monthly payment shock by negotiating lower prices for equivalent cars. Our results suggest that durable goods prices adjust to reflect credit terms even at the individual level, with one year of additional loan maturity increasing a car's price by 2.8%."
"Inalienable Customer Capital, Corporate Liquidity, and Stock Returns",WINSTON WEI DOU,10 July 2020,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12960,"ABSTRACTWe develop a model in which customer capital depends on key talents' contribution and pure brand recognition. Customer capital guarantees stable demand but is fragile to financial constraints risk if retained mainly by talents, who tend to quit financially constrained firms, damaging customer capital. Using a proprietary, granular brand-perception survey, we construct a firm-level measure of the inalienability of customer capital (ICC) that captures the degree to which customer capital depends on talents. Firms with higher ICC have higher average returns, higher talent turnover, and more precautionary financial policies. The ICC-sorted long-short portfolio's spread comoves with financial constraints factor."
A Dynamic Model of Optimal Creditor Dispersion,HONGDA ZHONG,24 September 2020,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12974,"ABSTRACTBorrowing from multiple creditors exposes firms to rollover risk due to coordination problems among creditors, but it also improves firms' repayment incentives, thereby increasing pledgeability. Based on this trade-off, I develop a dynamic debt rollover model to analyze the evolution of creditor dispersion. Consistent with empirical evidence, I find that firms optimally increase creditor dispersion after poor performance. In contrast, cross-sectionally higher-growth firms can support more dispersed creditors. Frequent debt renegotiation limits firms' ability to increase pledgeability by having more creditors. Finally, holding a cash balance while borrowing from multiple creditors improves firms' repayment incentives uniformly across all future states."
A Unified Model of Firm Dynamics with Limited Commitment and Assortative Matching,HENGJIE AI,04 October 2020,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12980,"ABSTRACTWe develop a unified theory of dynamic contracting and assortative matching to explain firm dynamics. In our model, neither firms nor managers can commit to arrangements that yield lower payoffs than their outside options, which are microfounded by the equilibrium conditions in a matching market. The model endogenously generates power laws in firm size and CEO compensation, and explains differences in their right tails. We also show that our model quantitatively accounts for many salient features of the time-series dynamics and the cross-sectional distribution of firm investment, dividend payout, and CEO compensation."
Information Consumption and Asset Pricing,AZI BEN-REPHAEL,25 September 2020,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12975,"ABSTRACTWe study whether firm and macroeconomic announcements that convey systematic information generate a return premium for firms that experience information spillovers. We use information consumption to proxy for investor learning during these announcements and construct ex ante measures of expected information consumption (EIC) to calibrate whether learning is priced. On days when there are information spillovers, affected stocks earn a significant return premium (5% annualized) and the capital asset pricing model performs better. The positive effect of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee announcements on the risk premia of individual stocks appears to be modulated by EIC. Our findings are most consistent with a risk-based explanation."
Learning From Disagreement in the U.S. Treasury Bond Market,MARCO GIACOLETTI,27 July 2020,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12971,"ABSTRACTWe study risk premiums in the U.S. Treasury bond market from the perspective of a Bayesian econometricianBLwho learns in real time from disagreement among investors about future bond yields. Notably, disagreement has substantial predictive power for yields, andBL's risk premiums are less volatile than those in the analogous model without learning.BL's forecasts are substantially more accurate than the consensus forecasts of market professionals, particularly following U.S. recessions. The predictive power of disagreement is distinct from the (much weaker) one of inflation and output growth. Rather, it appears to reflect uncertainty about future fiscal policy."
Information Inertia,PHILIPP K. ILLEDITSCH,04 October 2020,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.12979,"ABSTRACTWe show that aversion to risk and ambiguity leads to information inertia when investors process public news about assets. Optimal portfolios do not always depend on news that is worse than expected; hence, the equilibrium stock price does not reflect this bad news. This informational inefficiency is more severe when there is more risk and ambiguity but disappears when investors are risk-neutral or the news is about idiosyncratic risk. Information inertia leads to news momentum (e.g., after earnings announcements) and is consistent with low household trading activity. An ambiguity premium helps explain the macro and earnings announcement premium."

Loan Terms and Collateral: Evidence from the Bilateral Repo Market,JUN KYUNG AUH,04 October 2022,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13184,"ABSTRACTWe study secured lending contracts using a proprietary, loan-level database of bilateral repurchase agreements containing groups of simultaneous loans backed by multiple tranches within a securitization. We show that lower-quality loans (i.e., loans backed by lower-rated collateral) have higher margins and spreads. We calibrate a model using collateral asset prices and find that lower-quality loans are riskier despite the higher margins, yet cheaper for the borrower. This finding is consistent with a combination of lender optimism and reaching for yield. We also show that lower-quality loans have longer maturity, consistent with models of rollover concerns with asymmetric information."
Import Competition and Household Debt,JEAN-NOËL BARROT,11 October 2022,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13185,ABSTRACTWe analyze the effect of import competition on household balance sheets using individual data on consumer finances. We exploit variation in local industry exposure to foreign competition to study households' response to the income shock triggered by China's accession to the World Trade Organization. We show that household debt increases significantly in regions where manufacturing industries are more exposed to import competition. The effects are driven by home equity extraction and are concentrated in areas with strong house price growth. Our results highlight the role played by mortgage markets in absorbing displacement shocks triggered by globalization.
The Two-Pillar Policy for the RMB,URBAN J. JERMANN,18 September 2022,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13178,"ABSTRACTThis paper studies China's recent exchange rate policy for the renminbi (RMB). We demonstrate empirically that a two-pillar policy is in place, aiming to balance exchange rate flexibility and RMB index stability viamarketandbasketpillars. We further extend and validate the formulation that incorporates the so-called countercyclical factor. Theoretically, we develop a flexible-price monetary model for the RMB in which the two-pillar policy arises endogenously as an optimal response of the government. We estimate the model by generalized method of moments and quantitatively assess various policy trade-offs."
Attention-Induced Trading and Returns: Evidence from Robinhood Users,BRAD M. BARBER,30 September 2022,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13183,"ABSTRACTWe study the influence of financial innovation by fintech brokerages on individual investors’ trading and stock prices. Using data from Robinhood, we find that Robinhood investors engage in more attention-induced trading than other retail investors. For example, Robinhood outages disproportionately reduce trading in high-attention stocks. While this evidence is consistent with Robinhood attracting relatively inexperienced investors, we show that it is also driven in part by the app's unique features. Consistent with models of attention-induced trading, intense buying by Robinhood users forecasts negative returns. Average 20-day abnormal returns are −4.7% for the top stocks purchased each day."
Belief Disagreement and Portfolio Choice,MAARTEN MEEUWIS,18 September 2022,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13179,"ABSTRACTUsing proprietary financial data on millions of households, we show that likely-Republicans increased the equity share and market beta of their portfolios following the 2016 presidential election, while likely-Democrats rebalanced into safe assets. We provide evidence that this behavior was driven by investors interpreting public information based on different models of the world. We use detailed controls to rule out the main nonbelief-based channels such as income hedging needs, preferences, and local economic exposures. These findings are driven by a small share of investors making big changes, and are stronger among investors who trade more ex ante."
Asset Pricing with Cohort-Based Trading in MBS Markets,NICOLA FUSARI,19 September 2022,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13180,"ABSTRACTAgency mortgage-backed securities (MBSs) with diverse characteristics are traded in parallel through individualized specified pool (SP) contracts and standardized to-be-announced (TBA) contracts with delivery flexibility. This parallel trading environment generates distinctive effects on MBS pricing and trading: (i) Although cheapest-to-deliver (CTD) issues are present in TBA trading and absent from SP trading by design, MBS heterogeneity associated with CTD discounts affects SP yields positively, with the effect stronger for lower-value SPs; (ii) high selling pressure amplifies the effects of MBS heterogeneity on SP yields; and (iii) greater MBS heterogeneity dampens SP and TBA trading activities but increases their ratio."
The Price of Higher Order Catastrophe Insurance: The Case of VIX Options,BJØRN ERAKER,27 September 2022,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13182,"ABSTRACTWe develop a tractable equilibrium pricing model to explain observed characteristics in equity returns, VIX futures, S&P 500 options, and VIX options data based on affine jump-diffusive state dynamics and representative agents endowed with Duffie-Epstein recursive preferences. Our calibrated model replicates consumption, dividends, and asset market data, including VIX futures returns, the average implied volatilities in SPX and VIX options, and first- and higher-order moments of VIX options returns. We document a time variation in the shape of VIX-option-implied volatility and a time-varying hedging relationship between VIX and SPX options that our model both captures."
Financial Crises and Political Radicalization: How Failing Banks Paved Hitler's Path to Power,SEBASTIAN DOERR,22 June 2022,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13166,"ABSTRACTDo financial crises radicalize voters? We study Germany's 1931 banking crisis, collecting new data on bank branches and firm-bank connections. Exploiting cross-sectional variation in precrisis exposure to the bank at the center of the crisis, we show that Nazi votes surged in locations more affected by its failure. Radicalization in response to the shock was exacerbated in cities with a history of anti-Semitism. After the Nazis seized power, both pogroms and deportations were more frequent in places affected by the banking crisis. Our results suggest an important synergy between financial distress and cultural predispositions, with far-reaching consequences."
Stock Market Spillovers via the Global Production Network: Transmission of U.S. Monetary Policy,JULIAN DI GIOVANNI,19 September 2022,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13181,"ABSTRACTWe quantify the role of global production linkages in explaining spillovers of U.S. monetary policy shocks on country-sector stock returns. We estimate a structural spatial autoregression (SAR) model that is consistent with an open-economy production network framework. Using the SAR model, we decompose the total impact of U.S. monetary policy on global stock returns into direct and network effects. Nearly 70% of the total impact is due to the network effect of global production linkages. Empirical counterfactuals show that shutting down global production linkages halves the total impact of U.S. monetary policy shocks."
The Anatomy of the Transmission of Macroprudential Policies,VIRAL V. ACHARYA,10 August 2022,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13170,"ABSTRACTWe analyze how regulatory constraints on household leverage—in the form of loan-to-income and loan-to-value limits—affect residential mortgage credit and house prices as well as other asset classes not directly targeted by the limits. Loan-level data suggest that mortgage credit is reallocated from low- to high-income borrowers and from urban to rural counties. This reallocation weakens the feedback between credit and house prices and slows house price growth in “hot” housing markets. Banks whose lending to households is more affected by the regulatory constraint drive this reallocation, but also substitute their risk-taking into holdings of securities and corporate credit."
The Cost of Capital for Banks: Evidence from Analyst Earnings Forecasts,JENS DICK-NIELSEN,04 July 2022,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13168,"ABSTRACTWe extract cost of capital measures for banks using analyst earnings forecasts, which we show are unbiased. We find that the cost of equity and the cost of debt decrease in the Tier 1 ratio, whereas total cost of capital is uncorrelated with the Tier 1 ratio. These findings suggest that investors adjust their return expectations for banks in accordance with the Modigliani–Miller conservation-of-risk principle. Hence, increased capital requirements arenotmade socially costly based on a notion that market pricing violates risk conservation. Equity can nevertheless still be privately costly for banks because of reduced subsidies."
Commodity Financialization and Information Transmission,ITAY GOLDSTEIN,14 June 2022,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13165,"ABSTRACTWe provide a model to understand the effects of commodity futures financialization on various market variables. We distinguish between financial speculators and financial hedgers and study their separate and combined effects on the informativeness of futures prices, the futures price bias, the comovement of futures prices with other markets, and the predictiveness of financial trading. We capture the interactions between commodity futures financialization and the real economy through spot prices and production decisions. A dynamic extension illustrates how key variables change over time in a period of acute financialization in a way that is consistent with observed empirical patterns."
When Should Bankruptcy Law Be Creditor- or Debtor-Friendly? Theory and Evidence,DAVID SCHOENHERR,09 August 2022,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13171,"ABSTRACTWe examine how creditor protection affects firms with different levels of owners' and managers' personal costs of bankruptcy (PCB). Theoretically, we show that firms with high PCB borrow and invest more under a more debtor-friendly management stay system, whereas firms with low PCB borrow and invest more under a more creditor-friendly receivership system. Intuitively, stronger creditor protection relaxes financial constraints but reduces credit demand. Which effect dominates depends on owners' and managers' PCB. Empirically, we find support for these predictions using a Korean bankruptcy reform that replaced receivership with management stay."
"Rare Disasters, Financial Development, and Sovereign Debt",SERGIO REBELO,13 August 2022,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13175,"ABSTRACTWe propose a model of sovereign debt in which countries vary in their level of financial development, defined as the extent to which they can issue debt denominated in domestic currency in international capital markets. We show that low levels of financial development generate the “debt intolerance” phenomenon that plagues emerging markets: it reduces overall debt capacity, increases credit spreads, and limits the country's ability to smooth consumption."
Common Ownership Does Not Have Anticompetitive Effects in the Airline Industry,PATRICK DENNIS,21 August 2022,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13176,"ABSTRACTInstitutions often own equity in multiple firms that compete in the same product market. Prior research has shown that these institutional “common owners” induce anticompetitive pricing behavior in the airline industry. This paper reevaluates this evidence and shows that the documented positive correlation between common ownership and airline ticket prices stems from the market share component of the common ownership measure, and not the ownership and control components. We further show that the results are sensitive to measures of investor control and to assumptions about equity holders' ownership and control during bankruptcy."
"Rising Intangible Capital, Shrinking Debt Capacity, and the U.S. Corporate Savings Glut",ANTONIO FALATO,19 August 2022,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13174,"ABSTRACTThis paper explores the connection between rising intangible capital and the secular upward trend in U.S. corporate cash holdings. We calibrate a dynamic model with two productive assets—tangible and intangible capital—in which only tangible capital can serve as collateral. We highlight the following points: (i) a shift toward intangible capital shrinks firms' debt capacity and leads them to hold more cash, (ii) the effect accounts for three-quarters of the observed trend in average cash ratios, and (iii) it also accounts for the upward trend of cash ratios in the cross-section of small and large firms and in the aggregate."
A Theory of Equivalent Expectation Measures for Contingent Claim Returns,SANJAY K. NAWALKHA,09 August 2022,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13172,"ABSTRACTThis paper introduces a dynamic change of measure approach for computing analytical solutions of expected future prices (and therefore, expected returns) of contingent claims over a finite horizon. The new approach constructs hybrid probability measures called equivalent expectation measures (EEMs) that provide the physical expectation of the claim's future price before the horizon date, and serve as pricing measures on or after the horizon date. The EEM theory can be used for empirical investigations of both the cross-section and the term structure of returns of contingent claims, such as Treasury bonds, corporate bonds, and financial derivatives."
The Golden Mean: The Risk-Mitigating Effect of Combining Tournament Rewards with High-Powered Incentives,DUNHONG JIN,14 July 2022,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13169,"ABSTRACTThe rewards received by financial managers depend on both relative performance (e.g., fund inflows based on fund rankings, promotions based on peer comparisons) and absolute performance (e.g., bonus payments for meeting accounting targets, hedge-fund incentive fees). Both relative and absolute performance rewards engender risk-taking. In this paper, we show that these two sources of risk-taking, relative and absolute performance rewards, mitigate the risk-taking incentives produced by the other. This mutual incentive-reduction effect generates a number of novel predictions about the relationship of managerial risk-taking with the structure of relative and absolute performance rewards."
CEO Political Leanings and Store-Level Economic Activity during the COVID-19 Crisis: Effects on Shareholder Value and Public Health,JOHN M. BIZJAK,09 August 2022,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13173,"ABSTRACTMaintaining economic output during the COVID-19 pandemic results in benefits for firm shareholders but comes at a potential cost to public health. Using store-level data, we examine how a CEO's political leaning impacts this trade-off. We document that firms with a Republican-leaning CEO experience a relative increase in store visits compared to firms with a Democratic-leaning CEO. The increase in store visits is associated with higher sales and positive abnormal stock returns. However, we also document higher COVID-19 transmission rates and more employee safety complaints in communities where establishments with higher store traffic are managed by a Republican-leaning CEO."
Presidential Address: Corporate Finance and Reality,JOHN R. GRAHAM,30 May 2022,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13161,"ABSTRACTThis paper uses surveys to document CFO perspectives on corporate planning, investment, capital structure, payout, and shareholder versus stakeholder focus. Comparing policy decisions today to those 20 years ago, I find that companies employ decision rules that are conservative, sticky, and geared to time the market; rely on internal forecasts that are miscalibrated and considered reliable only two years ahead; and emphasize corporate objectives that focus increasingly on stakeholders and revenues. These practice of corporate finance themes can discipline academic models toward better explaining outcomes. Models of satisficing decision-making or costly managerial biases align with many of the themes."
Do Firms Respond to Gender Pay Gap Transparency?,MORTEN BENNEDSEN,03 May 2022,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13136,"ABSTRACTWe examine the effect of pay transparency on the gender pay gap and firm outcomes. Using a 2006 legislation change in Denmark that requires firms to provide gender-disaggregated wage statistics, detailed employee-employer administrative data, and difference-in-differences and difference-in-discontinuities designs, we find that the law reduces the gender pay gap, primarily by slowing wage growth for male employees. The gender pay gap declines by 2 percentage points, or 13% relative to the prelegislation mean. Despite the reduction of the overall wage bill, the wage transparency mandate does not affect firm profitability, likely because of the offsetting effect of reduced firm productivity."
Bank Market Power and Monetary Policy Transmission: Evidence from a Structural Estimation,YIFEI WANG,25 May 2022,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13159,"ABSTRACTWe quantify the impact of bank market power on monetary policy transmission through banks to borrowers. We estimate a dynamic banking model in which monetary policy affects imperfectly competitive banks' funding costs. Banks optimize the pass-through of these costs to borrowers and depositors, while facing capital and reserve regulation. We find that bank market power explains much of the transmission of monetary policy to borrowers, with an effect comparable to that of bank capital regulation. When the federal funds rate falls below 0.9%, market power interacts with bank capital regulation to produce a reversal of the effect of monetary policy."
Quantifying Reduced-Form Evidence on Collateral Constraints,SYLVAIN CATHERINE,25 May 2022,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13158,"ABSTRACTThis paper quantifies the aggregate effects of financing constraints. We start from a standard dynamic investment model with collateral constraints. In contrast to the existing quantitative literature, our estimation does not target the mean leverage ratio to identify the scope of financing frictions. Instead, we use a reduced-form coefficient from the recent corporate finance literature that connects exogenous debt capacity shocks to corporate investment. Relative to a frictionless benchmark, collateral constraints induce losses of 7.1% for output and 1.4% for total factor productivity (TFP) (misallocation). We show these estimated losses tend to be more robust to misspecification than estimates obtained by targeting leverage."
A New Test of Risk Factor Relevance,ALEX CHINCO,25 April 2022,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13135,"ABSTRACTTextbook models assume that investors try to insure against bad states of the world associated with specific risk factors when investing. This is a testable assumption and we develop a survey framework for doing so. Our framework can be applied to any risk factor. We demonstrate the approach using consumption growth, which makes our results applicable to most modern asset-pricing models. Participants respond to changes in the mean and volatility of stock returns consistent with textbook models, but we find no evidence that they view an asset's correlation with consumption growth as relevant to investment decisions."
Testing Disagreement Models,YEN-CHENG CHANG,11 May 2022,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13137,"ABSTRACTWe provide plausibly identified evidence for the role of investor disagreement in asset pricing. Our natural experiment exploits the staggered implementation of the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR) system, which induces a reduction in investor disagreement. Consistent with models of investor disagreement, EDGAR inclusion helps resolve disagreement around information events, leading to stock price corrections. The reduction in disagreement following EDGAR inclusion also reduces stock price crash risk, especially among stocks with binding short-sale constraints and high investor optimism."
Debt Refinancing and Equity Returns,NILS FRIEWALD,30 May 2022,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13162,"ABSTRACTThis paper presents empirical evidence that the maturity structure of financial leverage affects the cross-section of equity returns. We find that short-term leverage is associated with a positive premium, whereas long-term leverage is not. The premium for short-term compared to long-term leverage reflects higher exposure of equity to systematic risk. To rationalize our findings, we show that the same patterns emerge in a model of debt rollover risk with endogenous leverage and debt maturity choice. Our results suggest that analyses of leverage effects in asset prices and corporate financial applications should account for the maturity structure of debt."
Risk-Sharing and the Term Structure of Interest Rates,ANDRÉS SCHNEIDER,11 May 2022,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13139,ABSTRACTI propose a general equilibrium model with heterogeneous investors to explain the key properties of the U.S. real and nominal term structure of interest rates. I find that differences in investors' elasticities of intertemporal substitution are critical in accounting for the dynamics of nominal and real yields. The nominal term structure is driven primarily by real shocks so that it can be upward sloping regardless of the correlation between nominal and real shocks.
Stock Market's Assessment of Monetary Policy Transmission: The Cash Flow Effect,REFET GÜRKAYNAK,30 May 2022,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13163,"ABSTRACTWe show that firm liability structure and associated cash flows matter for firm behavior and that financial market participants price stocks accordingly. Stock price reactions to monetary policy announcements depend on the type and maturity of debt issued by the firms and the forward guidance provided by the Fed, both at and away from the zero lower bound. Further, the marginal stock market participant knows the current liability structures of firms and does not rely on rules of thumb. The cash flow exposure at the time of monetary policy actions predicts future investment, assets, and net worth, clearly violating the Modigliani-Miller theorem."
The Economics of Deferral and Clawback Requirements,FLORIAN HOFFMANN,28 May 2022,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13160,"ABSTRACTWe analyze the effects of regulatory interference in compensation contracts, focusing on recent mandatory deferral and clawback requirements restricting incentive compensation of material risk-takers in the financial sector. Moderate deferral requirements have a robustly positive effect on risk-management effort only if the bank manager's outside option is sufficiently high; otherwise, their effectiveness depends on the dynamics of information arrival. Stringent deferral requirements unambiguously backfire. Our normative analysis characterizes whether and how deferral and clawback requirements should supplement capital regulation as part of the optimal policy mix."
"Financial Crisis, Creditor-Debtor Conflict, and Populism",GYŐZŐ GYÖNGYÖSI,04 May 2022,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13138,"ABSTRACTWe study the impact of debtor distress on support for a populist far-right political party during a financial crisis. Our empirical approach exploits variation in exposure to foreign currency household loans during a currency crisis in Hungary. Foreign currency debt exposure leads to a large, persistent increase in support for the populist far right. We document that the far right advocated for foreign currency debtors' interests by proposing aggressive debt relief and was rewarded with support from these voters. Our findings are consistent with theories emphasizing that conflict between creditors and debtors can shape political outcomes after financial crises."
"Barbarians at the Store? Private Equity, Products, and Consumers",CESARE FRACASSI,11 April 2022,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13134,"ABSTRACTWe investigate the effects of private equity firms on product markets using price and sales data for an extensive number of consumer products. Following a private equity deal, target firms increase retail sales of their products 50% more than matched control firms. Price increases—roughly 1% on existing products—do not drive this growth; the launch of new products and geographic expansion do. Competitors reduce their product offerings and marginally raise prices. Cross-sectional results on target firms, private equity firms, the economic environment, and product categories suggest that private equity generates growth by easing financial constraints and providing managerial expertise."
The Wisdom of the Robinhood Crowd,IVO WELCH,28 March 2022,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13128,"ABSTRACTRobinhood investors increased their holdings in the March 2020 COVID bear market, indicating an absence of collective panic and margin calls. This steadfastness was rewarded in the subsequent bull market. Despite unusual interest in some “experience” stocks (e.g., cannabis stocks), they tilted primarily toward stocks with high past share volume and dollar-trading volume (themselves mostly big stocks). From mid-2018 to mid-2020, an aggregated crowd consensus portfolio (a proxy for the household-equal-weighted portfolio) had both good timing and good alpha."
Fully Closed: Individual Responses to Realized Gains and Losses,STEFFEN MEYER,27 March 2022,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13122,ABSTRACTWe analyze how individuals reinvest realized capital gains and losses exploiting plausibly exogenous sales due to mutual fund liquidations. Individuals reinvest 83% if a forced sale results in a gain relative to the initial investment; but reinvest only 40% in the event of a loss. This difference is statistically significant for more than six months and arises because many individuals forced to realize a loss choose not to reinvest anything and some even exit the stock market altogether. Individuals treat realized losses differently from paper losses and are discouraged from investing more and participating in the stock market.
Long-Run Risk: Is It There?,YUKUN LIU,29 March 2022,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13126,"ABSTRACTThis paper documents the existence of a persistent component in consumption growth. We take a novel approach using news coverage to capture investor concern about economic growth prospects. We provide evidence that consumption growth is highly predictable over long horizons—our measure explains between 23% and 38% of cumulative future consumption growth at the five-year horizon and beyond. Furthermore, we show a strong connection between this predictability and asset prices. Innovations to our measure price 51 standard portfolios in the cross section and our one-factor model outperforms many benchmark macro- and return-based multifactor models."
The Limits of Model-Based Regulation,MARKUS BEHN,27 March 2022,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13124,"ABSTRACTUsing loan-level data from Germany, we investigate how the introduction of model-based capital regulation affected banks' ability to absorb shocks. The objective of this regulation was to enhance financial stability by making capital requirements responsive to asset risk. Our evidence suggests that banks “optimized” model-based regulation to lower their capital requirements. Banks systematically underreported risk, with underreporting more pronounced for banks with higher gains from it. Moreover, large banks benefitted from the regulation at the expense of smaller banks. Overall, our results suggest that sophisticated rules may have undesired effects if strategic misbehavior is difficult to detect."
Resource Allocation in Bank Supervision: Trade-Offs and Outcomes,THOMAS M. EISENBACH,29 March 2022,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13127,"ABSTRACTWe estimate a structural model of resource allocation on work hours of Federal Reserve bank supervisors to disentangle how supervisory technology, preferences, and resource constraints impact bank outcomes. We find a significant effect of supervision on bank risk and large technological scale economies with respect to bank size. Consistent with macroprudential objectives, revealed supervisory preferences disproportionately weight larger banks, especially post-2008 when a resource reallocation to larger banks increased risk on average across all banks. Shadow cost estimates show tight resources around the financial crisis and counterfactuals indicate that binding constraints have large effects on the distribution of bank outcomes."
Learning by Owning in a Lemons Market,JORDAN MARTEL,27 March 2022,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13125,"ABSTRACTWe study market dynamics when an owner learns about the quality of her asset over time. Since this information is private, the owner sells strategically to a less informed buyer following sufficient negative information. In response, market prices feature a “U-shape” and trading probabilities a “hump-shape” with respect to the time to sale. As the owner initially acquires greater information, buyers suffer greater adverse selection, and prices fall accordingly. Eventually, the probability of an informed sale shrinks, and prices rebound. We provide evidence consistent with our model in markets for residential real estate, venture capital investments, and construction equipment."
Is There a Risk Premium in the Stock Lending Market? Evidence from Equity Options,DMITRIY MURAVYEV,03 April 2022,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13129,"ABSTRACTRecent research argues that uncertainty about future stock borrowing fees hinders short-selling, and this risk explains the performance of short strategies. One possible mechanism is that borrowing fee risk carries a risk premium. Since the present value of the uncertain borrowing fee is reflected in options prices, the difference between option-implied and realized fees estimates this premium. We find that the risk premium is small. Moreover, if the risk premium is substantial, it should be reflected in the returns to short-selling stock after adjusting for stock borrowing fees. However, borrowing fee risk does not predict fee-adjusted returns."
Are Analyst Short-Term Trade Ideas Valuable?,JUSTIN BIRRU,12 April 2022,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13130,"ABSTRACTShort-term trade ideas are a component of analyst research highly valued by institutional investors. Using a novel and comprehensive database, we find that trade ideas have a stock price impact at least as large as recommendation and target price changes. Trade ideas based on expectations of future events are more informative than those identifying incomplete incorporation of past information in stock prices. Analysts with better access to a firm's management produce better trade ideas. Institutional investors trade in the direction of trade ideas. Investors following trade ideas can earn significant abnormal returns, consistent with analysts possessing valuable short-term stock-picking skills."
Factor Momentum and the Momentum Factor,SINA EHSANI,07 April 2022,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13131,ABSTRACTMomentum in individual stock returns relates to momentum in factor returns. Most factors are positively autocorrelated: the average factor earns a monthly return of six basis points following a year of losses and 51 basis points following a positive year. We find that factor momentum concentrates in factors that explain more of the cross section of returns and that it is not incidental to individual stock momentum: momentum-neutral factors display more momentum. Momentum found in high-eigenvalue principal component factors subsumes most forms of individual stock momentum. Our results suggest that momentum is not a distinct risk factor—it times other factors.
Luck versus Skill in the Cross Section of Mutual Fund Returns: Reexamining the Evidence,CAMPBELL R. HARVEY,27 March 2022,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13123,"ABSTRACTWhile Kosowski et al. (2006,Journal of Finance61, 2551–2595) and Fama and French (2010,Journal of Finance65, 1915–1947) both evaluate whether mutual funds outperform, their conclusions are very different. We reconcile their findings. We show that the Fama-French method suffers from an undersampling problem that leads to a failure to reject the null hypothesis of zero alpha, even when some funds generate economically large risk-adjusted returns. In contrast, Kosowski et al. substantially overreject the null hypothesis, even when all funds have a zero alpha. We present a novel bootstrapping approach that should be useful to future researchers choosing between the two approaches."
The Fragility of Market Risk Insurance,RALPH S.J. KOIJEN,11 February 2022,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13118,"ABSTRACTVariable annuities, which package mutual funds with minimum return guarantees over long horizons, accounted for $1.5 trillion or 35% of U.S. life insurer liabilities in 2015. Sales decreased and fees increased during the global financial crisis, and insurers made guarantees less generous or stopped offering guarantees to reduce risk exposure. These effects persist in the low-interest rate environment after the global financial crisis, and variable annuity insurers suffered large equity drawdowns during the COVID-19 crisis. We develop and estimate a model of insurance markets in which financial frictions and market power determine pricing, contract characteristics, and the degree of market completeness."
Predictable Financial Crises,ROBIN GREENWOOD,27 January 2022,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13105,"ABSTRACTUsing historical data on postwar financial crises around the world, we show that the combination of rapid credit and asset price growth over the prior three years, whether in the nonfinancial business or the household sector, is associated with a 40% probability of entering a financial crisis within the next three years. This compares with a roughly 7% probability in normal times, when neither credit nor asset price growth is elevated. Our evidence challenges the view that financial crises are unpredictable “bolts from the sky” and supports the Kindleberger-Minsky view that crises are the byproduct of predictable, boom-bust credit cycles. This predictability favors policies that lean against incipient credit-market booms."
Late to Recessions: Stocks and the Business Cycle,ROBERTO GÓMEZ-CRAM,11 December 2021,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13100,"ABSTRACTI find that returns are predictably negative for several months after the onset of recessions, becoming high only thereafter. I identify business cycle turning points by estimating a state-space model using macroeconomic data. Conditioning on the business cycle further reveals that returns exhibit momentum in recessions, whereas in expansions they display the mild reversals expected from discount rate changes. A strategy exploiting this pattern produces positive alphas. Using analyst forecast data, I show that my findings are consistent with investors' slow reaction to recessions. When expected returns are negative, analysts are too optimistic and their downward expectation revisions are exceptionally high."
Monetary Policy and Asset Valuation,FRANCESCO BIANCHI,19 January 2022,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13107,"ABSTRACTWe document large, longer term, joint regime shifts in asset valuations and the real federal funds rate-r*$r^{\ast }$spread. To interpret these findings, we estimate a novel macrofinance model of monetary transmission and find that the documented regimes coincide with shifts in the parameters of a policy rule, with long-term consequences for the real interest rate. Estimates imply that two-thirds of the decline in the real interest rate since the early 1980s is attributable to regime changes in monetary policy. The model explains how infrequent changes in the stance of monetary policy can generate persistent changes in asset valuations and the equity premium."
Payment System Externalities,CHRISTINE A. PARLOUR,03 February 2022,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13110,"ABSTRACTWe examine how the payment processing role of banks affects their lending activity. In our model, banks operate in separate zones, and issue claims to entrepreneurs who purchase some inputs outside their own zone. Settling bank claims across zones incurs a cost. In equilibrium, a liquidity externality arises when zones are sufficiently different in their outsourcing propensities—a bank may restrict its own lending because it needs to hold liquidity against claims issued by another bank. Our work highlights that the disparate motives for interbank borrowing (investing in productive projects and managing liquidity) can have different effects on efficiency."
Volatility Expectations and Returns,LARS A. LOCHSTOER,11 February 2022,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13120,"ABSTRACTWe provide evidence that agents have slow-moving beliefs about stock market volatility that lead to initial underreaction to volatility shocks followed by delayed overreaction. These dynamics are mirrored in the VIX and variance risk premiums, which reflect investor expectations about volatility, and are also supported in both surveys and firm-level option prices. We embed these expectations into an asset pricing model and find that the model can account for a number of stylized facts about market returns and return volatility that are difficult to reconcile, including a weak or even negative risk-return trade-off."
Dissecting Conglomerate Valuations,OLIVER BOGUTH,19 February 2022,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13117,"ABSTRACTWe develop a new method to estimate Tobin's Qs of conglomerate divisions without relying on standalone firms. Divisional Qs differ considerably from those of standalone firms across industries, over time, and in their sensitivity to economic shocks. The differences are explained by intraconglomerate covariance structures and access to internal capital markets that mitigate external financing frictions. Consequently, the Qs capture variation in the allocation of assets in the economy: within firms through internal capital markets and across focused and diversified firms through diversifying acquisitions. Overall, our method provides opportunities to study the economic mechanisms that explain corporate diversification."
Common Risk Factors in Cryptocurrency,YUKUN LIU,11 February 2022,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13119,"ABSTRACTWe find that three factors—cryptocurrency market, size, and momentum—capture the cross-sectional expected cryptocurrency returns. We consider a comprehensive list of price- and market-related return predictors in the stock market and construct their cryptocurrency counterparts. Ten cryptocurrency characteristics form successful long-short strategies that generate sizable and statistically significant excess returns, and we show that all of these strategies are accounted for by the cryptocurrency three-factor model. Lastly, we examine potential underlying mechanisms of the cryptocurrency size and momentum effects."
Do Market Prices Improve the Accuracy of Court Valuations in Chapter 11?,CEM DEMIROGLU,04 February 2022,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13111,"ABSTRACTThe average difference between the court value and postemergence market value of newly issued stocks in Chapter 11 reorganizations exceeds 50%. We show that public dissemination of transactions in defaulted bonds reduces this difference by 23% and largely eliminates interclaimant wealth transfers. The effects of dissemination are only significant when the bonds are sufficiently traded around the court valuation date and when they receive significant amounts of postemergence equity, indicating that the bond's value is sensitive to the size and allocation of the pie. These findings imply that security prices have real effects: they improve the valuations of bankruptcy participants."
Regulation of Charlatans in High-Skill Professions,JONATHAN B. BERK,06 February 2022,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13112,"ABSTRACTWe model a market for a skill in short supply and high demand, where the presence of charlatans (professionals who sell a service they do not deliver on) is an equilibrium outcome. In the model, reducing the number of charlatans through regulation lowers consumer surplus because of the resulting reduction in competition among producers. Producers can benefit from this reduction, potentially explaining the regulation we observe. The effect on total surplus depends on the type of regulation. We derive the factors that drive the cross-sectional variation in charlatans (regulation) across professions."
Going the Extra Mile: Distant Lending and Credit Cycles,JOÃO GRANJA,07 February 2022,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13114,"ABSTRACTThe average distance of U.S. banks from their small corporate borrowers increased before the global financial crisis, especially for banks in competitive counties. Small distant loans are harder to make, so loan quality deteriorated. Surprisingly, such lending intensified as the Fed raised interest rates from 2004. Why? We show that banks' responses to higher rates led bank deposits to shift into competitive counties. Short-horizon bank management recycled these inflows into risky loans to distant uncompetitive counties. Thus, rate hikes, competition, and managerial short-termism explain why inflows “burned a hole” in banks' pockets and, more generally, increased risky lending."
Liquidity Fluctuations in Over-the-Counter Markets,VINCENT MAURIN,17 January 2022,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13106,"ABSTRACTThis paper proposes a theory of excess price fluctuations in over-the-counter secondary markets. When heterogeneous assets trade under asymmetric information, a quality effect emerges: high liquidity lowers the quality of the pool of sellers and decreases future liquidity. Cyclical equilibria can arise even without fundamental shocks. In a cycle, investors speculate by bidding up the price of low-quality assets, anticipating a high resale price at the peak. When this resale effect is strong, cycles disappear and multiple steady states coexist with different levels of liquidity. The model rationalizes empirical patterns for corporate bonds and housing in particular."
Do Equity Markets Care about Income Inequality? Evidence from Pay Ratio Disclosure,YIHUI PAN,06 February 2022,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13113,"ABSTRACTWe examine equity markets’ reaction to the first-time disclosure of the CEO-worker pay ratio by U.S. public companies in 2018. We find that firms disclosing higher pay ratios experience significantly lower abnormal announcement returns. Firms whose shareholders are more inequality-averse experience a more negative market response to high pay ratios. Furthermore, during 2018 more inequality-averse investors rebalance their portfolios away from stocks with a high pay ratio relative to other investors. Our results suggest that equity markets are concerned about high within-firm pay dispersion, and investors’ inequality aversion is a channel through which high pay ratios negatively affect firm value."
Report of the Editor of The Journal of Finance for the Year 2021,STEFAN NAGEL,21 March 2022,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13115,
Cultural Biases in Equity Analysis,VESA PURSIAINEN,08 November 2021,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13095,"ABSTRACTA more positive cultural trust bias by an equity analyst's country of origin toward a firm's headquarter country is associated with significantly more positive stock recommendations. The cultural bias effect is stronger for eponymous firms whose names mention their home country and varies over time, increasing with negative sentiment. I find evidence of a negative North-South bias during the European debt crisis and United Kingdom-Europe divergence amid Brexit. Share price reactions to recommendations by more biased analysts are weaker, and more biased recommendations are worse predictors of monthly stock returns. More positively biased analysts also assign higher target prices."
Selling Fast and Buying Slow: Heuristics and Trading Performance of Institutional Investors,KLAKOW AKEPANIDTAWORN,11 August 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13271,"ABSTRACTAre market experts prone to heuristics, and do these heuristics transfer across buying and selling domains? We investigate this question using a unique data set of institutional investors with portfolios averaging $573 million. A striking finding emerges: While there is evidence of skill in buying, selling decisions underperform substantially, even relative to random-selling strategies. This holds despite the similarity between the two decisions in frequency, substance, and consequences for performance. Evidence suggests an asymmetric allocation of cognitive resources such as attention can explain the discrepancy: We document a systematic, costly heuristic process for selling but not for buying."
Informational Black Holes in Financial Markets,ULF AXELSON,15 August 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13270,"ABSTRACTWe show that information aggregation in primary financial markets fails precisely when investors hold socially useful information for screening projects. Being wary of the Winner's Curse, less optimistic investors refrain from making financing offers, since their offers would be accepted only when a project is unviable. Their information is therefore lost. The Winner's Curse and associated information loss grow with the number of informed market participants, so that larger markets can lead to worse financing decisions and higher cost of capital for firms seeking financing. Precommitment to ration fundraising allocations, collusive club bidding, and shorting markets can mitigate the inefficiency."
Option Momentum,STEVEN L. HESTON,17 September 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13279,"ABSTRACTThis paper investigates the performance of option investments across different stocks by computing monthly returns on at-the-money straddles on individual equities. We find that options with high historical returns continue to significantly outperform options with low historical returns over horizons ranging from 6 to 36 months. This phenomenon is robust to including out-of-the-money options or delta-hedging the returns. Unlike stock momentum, option return continuation is not followed by long-run reversal. Significant returns remain after factor risk adjustment and after controlling for implied volatility and other characteristics. Across stocks, trading costs are unrelated to the magnitude of momentum profits."
(Re-)Imag(in)ing Price Trends,JINGWEN JIANG,02 August 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13268,"ABSTRACTWe reconsider trend-based predictability by employing flexible learning methods to identify price patterns that are highly predictive of returns, as opposed to testing predefined patterns like momentum or reversal. Our predictor data are stock-level price charts, allowing us to extract the most predictive price patterns using machine learning image analysis techniques. These patterns differ significantly from commonly analyzed trend signals, yield more accurate return predictions, enable more profitable investment strategies, and demonstrate robustness across specifications. Remarkably, they exhibit context independence, as short-term patterns perform well on longer time scales, and patterns learned from U.S. stocks prove effective in international markets."
Household Liquidity Constraints and Labor Market Outcomes: Evidence from a Danish Mortgage Reform,ALEX XI HE,14 September 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13277,"ABSTRACTWe study the causal effect of liquidity constraints on individual labor market outcomes by exploiting the 1992 mortgage reform in Denmark, which for the first time allowed homeowners to borrow against housing equity for nonhousing purposes. Following the reform, liquidity-constrained homeowners increased debt levels and had higher earnings growth and lower employment rates. The option to borrow against housing equity enabled liquidity-constrained individuals to move to high-wage jobs and invest in valuable human and physical capital. The results imply that relaxing household liquidity constraints during recessions can create better job matches, potentially increasing earnings and output in the longer run."
"Booms, Busts, and Common Risk Exposures",ALEXANDR KOPYTOV,03 October 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13283,"ABSTRACTI present a dynamic general equilibrium model in which commonality in bank assets endogenously changes over the business cycle and shapes systemic risk. To reduce individual risks, banks diversify, increasing portfolio overlap and hence the similarity of their exposures to fundamental shocks. Systemic financial crises burst at the end of credit booms when productive investment opportunities are exhausted, banks' diversification incentives are strong, and their portfolios are highly correlated. A calibrated model is able to match key moments related to frequency, severity, and the economy's behavior around systemic crises."
Entrepreneurial Wealth and Employment: Tracing Out the Effects of a Stock Market Crash,MARIUS A. K. RING,17 September 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13280,"ABSTRACTUsing the dispersion in stock returns during the financial crisis as a source of exogenous variation in the wealth of Norwegian entrepreneurs who held listed stocks, I show that adverse shocks to the wealth of business owners had large effects on their firms' financing, employment, and investment. The effects on investment and employment are driven by young firms, that obtain differentially less bank financing following an owner wealth shock. The effects on employment operate primarily through reduced hiring. My findings highlight that equity-financing frictions and the procyclicality of entrepreneurial wealth are important channels that can amplify economic shocks."
Operating Hedge and Gross Profitability Premium,LEONID KOGAN,13 September 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13275,"ABSTRACTWe show theoretically that variable production costs reduce systematic risk of firms' cash flows if capital and variable inputs are complementary in firms' production and input prices are procyclical. In our dynamic model, this operating hedge effect is weaker for more profitable firms, giving rise to a gross profitability premium. Moreover, gross profitability and value factors are distinct and negatively correlated, and their premia are not captured by the capital asset pricing model (CAPM). We estimate the model by simulated method of moments, and find that its main implications for stock returns and cash flow dynamics are quantitatively consistent with the data."
The Legal Origins of Financial Development: Evidence from the Shanghai Concessions,ROSS LEVINE,03 October 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13284,"ABSTRACTThe primary challenge to assessing the legal origins view of comparative financial development is identifying exogenous changes in legal systems. We assemble new data on Shanghai's British and French concessions between 1845 and 1936. Two regime changes altered British and French legal jurisdiction over their respective concessions. By examining the changing application of different legal traditions to adjacent neighborhoods within the same city and controlling for military, economic, and political characteristics, we offer new evidence consistent with the legal origins view: the financial development advantage in the British concession widened after Western legal jurisdiction intensified and narrowed after it abated."
Retail Trading in Options and the Rise of the Big Three Wholesalers,SVETLANA BRYZGALOVA,02 October 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13285,"ABSTRACTWe document a rapid increase in retail trading in options in the United States. Facilitated by payment for order flow (PFOF) from wholesalers executing retail orders, retail trading recently reached over 60% of total market volume. Nearly 90% of PFOF comes from three wholesalers. Exploiting new flags in transaction-level data, we isolate wholesaler trades and build a novel measure of retail options trading. Our measure comoves with equity-based retail activity proxies and drops significantly during U.S. brokerage platform outages and trading restrictions. Retail investors prefer cheaper, weekly options with average bid-ask spread of 12.6%, and lose money on average."
Attention Spillover in Asset Pricing,XIN CHEN,25 September 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13281,"ABSTRACTExploiting a screen display feature whereby the order of stock display is determined by the stock's listing code, we lever a novel identification strategy and study how the interaction between overconfidence and limited attention affect asset pricing. We find that stocks displayed next to those with higher returns in the past two weeks are associated with higher returns in the future week, which are reverted in the long run. This is consistent with our conjectures that investors tend to trade more after positive investment experience and are more likely to pay attention to neighboring stocks, both confirmed using trading data."
"Discount Rates, Debt Maturity, and the Fiscal Theory",ALEXANDRE CORHAY,02 October 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13282,"ABSTRACTThis paper examines how the transmission of government portfolio risk arising from maturity operations depends on the stance of monetary/fiscal policy. Accounting for risk premia in the fiscal theory allows the government portfolio to affect expected inflation, even in a frictionless economy. The effects of maturity rebalancing on expected inflation in the fiscal theory depend directly on the conditional nominal term premium, giving rise to an optimal debt-maturity policy that is state-dependent. In a calibrated macrofinance model, we demonstrate that maturity operations have sizable effects on expected inflation and output through our novel risk transmission mechanism."
Optimal Forbearance of Bank Resolution,LINDA M. SCHILLING,16 August 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13273,"ABSTRACTThis paper analyzes a regulator's optimal strategic delay of resolving banks when the regulator's announcement of the intervention delay endogenously affects the depositors' run propensity. Given intervention, the regulator either liquidates the remaining illiquid assets (“prompt corrective action”) or continues managing the assets at a reduced skill level (“resolution under receivership”). In either case, I show that if the regulator tolerates fewer withdrawals until intervention, the depositors may react by preempting the regulator: they run on the bank more often ex ante. A policy of never intervening can leave the bank more stable than a conservative intervention policy."
Global Pricing of Carbon-Transition Risk,PATRICK BOLTON,12 August 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13272,"ABSTRACTThe energy transition away from fossil fuels exposes companies to carbon-transition risk. Estimating the market-based premium associated with carbon-transition risk in a cross section of 14,400 firms in 77 countries, we find higher stock returns associated with higher levels and growth rates of carbon emissions in all sectors and most countries. Carbon premia related to emissions growth are greater for firms located in countries with lower economic development, larger energy sectors, and less inclusive political systems. Premia related to emission levels are higher in countries with stricter domestic climate policies. The latter have increased with investor awareness about climate change risk."

Moral Hazard versus Liquidity in Household Bankruptcy,SASHA INDARTE,14 July 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13263,"ABSTRACTThis paper studies the role of moral hazard and liquidity in driving household bankruptcy. First, I estimate that increases in potential debt forgiveness have a positive, but small, effect on filing using a regression kink design. Second, exploiting quasi-experimental variation in mortgage payment reductions, I estimate that filing is five times more responsive to cash-on-hand than relief generosity. Using a sufficient statistic, I show the estimates imply large consumption-smoothing benefits of bankruptcy for the marginal filer. Finally, I conclude that 83% of the filing response to dischargeable debt comes from liquidity effects rather than a moral hazard response to financial incentives."
Is There a Replication Crisis in Finance?,THEIS INGERSLEV JENSEN,26 May 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13249,"ABSTRACTSeveral papers argue that financial economics faces a replication crisis because the majority of studies cannot be replicated or are the result of multiple testing of too many factors. We develop and estimate a Bayesian model of factor replication that leads to different conclusions. The majority of asset pricing factors (i) can be replicated; (ii) can be clustered into 13 themes, the majority of which are significant parts of the tangency portfolio; (iii) work out-of-sample in a new large data set covering 93 countries; and (iv) have evidence that is strengthened (not weakened) by the large number of observed factors."
Complex Asset Markets,ANDREA L. EISFELDT,20 July 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13264,"ABSTRACTInvestors' individual arbitrage models introduce idiosyncratic risk into complex asset strategies, driving up average returns and Sharpe ratios. However, despite the attractive risk-return trade-off, participation is limited. This is because effective Sharpe ratios in complex asset markets vary with investors' expertise. Investors with higher expertise, better models, and lower resulting idiosyncratic risk exposures realize higher Sharpe ratios. Their demand deters entry by less sophisticated investors. As predicted by our model, market dislocations are characterized by an increase in idiosyncratic risk, investor exit, and persistently elevated alphas and Sharpe ratios. The selection effect from higher expertise agents' more favorable Sharpe ratios is unique to our model and key to our main results."
Pledgeability and Asset Prices: Evidence from the Chinese Corporate Bond Markets,HUI CHEN,18 July 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13266,"ABSTRACTWe provide causal evidence on the value of asset pledgeability by exploiting a unique feature of Chinese corporate bond markets: bonds with identical fundamentals are traded on two segmented markets with different rules for repo transactions. Using a policy shock that rendered AA+ and AA bonds ineligible for repo on one market only, we compare how bond prices changed across markets and rating classes around this event. When the haircut increases from 0% to 100%, bond yields increase by 39 bps to 85 bps. These estimates help us infer the magnitude of the shadow cost of capital in China."
Investor Tax Credits and Entrepreneurship: Evidence from U.S. States,MATTHEW DENES,01 August 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13267,"ABSTRACTAngel investor tax credits are used globally to spur high-growth entrepreneurship. Exploiting their staggered implementation in 31 U.S. states, we find that they increase angel investment yet have no significant impact on entrepreneurial activity. Two mechanisms explain these results: crowding out of alternative financing and low sensitivity of professional investors to tax credits. With a large-scale survey and a stylized model, we show that low responsiveness among professional angels may reflect the fat-tailed return distributions that characterize high-growth startups. The results contrast with evidence that direct subsidies to firms have positive effects, raising concerns about promoting entrepreneurship with investor subsidies."
Retail Financial Innovation and Stock Market Dynamics: The Case of Target Date Funds,JONATHAN A. PARKER,19 June 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13258,"ABSTRACTTarget date funds (TDFs) are designed to provide unsophisticated or inattentive investors with age-appropriate exposures to different asset classes like stocks and bonds. The rise of TDFs has moved a significant share of retirement investors into macrocontrarian strategies that sell stocks after relatively good stock market performance. This rebalancing drives contrarian flows across equity mutual funds held by TDFs, stabilizing their funding, and reduces stock returns for stocks disproportionately held by these funds when stock market returns are relatively high. Continued growth in TDFs and similar investment products may dampen stock market volatility and increase the transmission of shocks across asset classes."
Contracting in Peer Networks,PETER M. DEMARZO,14 July 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13260,"ABSTRACTWe consider multiagent multifirm contracting when agents benchmark their wages to those of their peers, using weights that vary within and across firms. When a single principal commits to a public contract, optimal contracts hedge relative wage risk without sacrificing efficiency. But compensation benchmarking undoes performance benchmarking, causing wages to load positively on peer output, and asymmetries in peer effects can be exploited to enhance profits. With multiple principals, a “rat race” emerges: agents are more productive, with effort that can exceed the first best, but higher wages reduce profits and undermine efficiency. Wage transparency and disclosure requirements exacerbate these effects."
"Dynamic Contracting with Intermediation: Operational, Governance, and Financial Engineering",SEBASTIAN GRYGLEWICZ,21 July 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13265,"ABSTRACTPrivate equity funds intermediate investment and affect portfolio firm performance by actively engaging in operational, governance, and financial engineering. We study this type of intermediation in a dynamic agency model in which an active intermediary raises funds from outside investors and invests in a firm run by an agent. Optimal contracting addresses moral hazard at the intermediary and firm levels. The intermediary's incentives to affect firm performance are strongest after poor performance, while the agent's incentives are strongest after good performance. We also show how financial engineering, that is, financial contracting with outside investors, interacts with operational and governance engineering."
Stealth Acquisitions and Product Market Competition,JOHN D. KEPLER,14 June 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13256,"ABSTRACTWe examine whether and how firms structure their merger and acquisition deals to avoid antitrust scrutiny. There are approximately 40% more mergers and acquisitions (M&As) than expected just below deal value thresholds that trigger antitrust review. These “stealth acquisitions” tend to involve financial and governance contract terms that afford greater scope for negotiating and assigning lower deal values. We also show that the equity values, gross margins, and product prices of acquiring firms and their competitors increase following such acquisitions. Our results suggest that acquirers manipulate M&As to avoid antitrust scrutiny, thereby benefiting their own shareholders but potentially harming other corporate stakeholders."
Do Credit Markets Respond to Macroeconomic Shocks? The Case for Reverse Causality,MARTIJN BOONS,14 July 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13261,"ABSTRACTThe response of corporate bond credit spreads to three exogenous macro shocks—oil supply, investment-specific technology, and government spending—is large, significant, and a mirror image of macroeconomic activity. This countercyclicality is driven largely by credit risk premia and translates into significant return predictability. Equity risk premia exhibit similar responses, providing external validity. Information rigidities and leverage play a key role in the transmission of the shocks. Since causal evidence linking macro shocks to credit markets is scarce and recent work highlights the real effects of credit fluctuations, our findings contribute to understanding the joint dynamics of credit markets and the macroeconomy."
Monetary Policy and Inequality,ASGER LAU ANDERSEN,15 July 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13262,"ABSTRACTWe analyze the distributional effects of monetary policy on income, wealth, and consumption. We use administrative household-level data covering the entire population in Denmark over the period 1987 to 2014 and exploit a long-standing currency peg as a source of exogenous variation in monetary policy. We find that gains from softer monetary policy in terms of income, wealth, and consumption are monotonically increasing in ex ante income. The distributional effects reflect systematic differences in exposure to the various channels of monetary policy, especially nonlabor channels (e.g., leverage and risky assets). Our estimates imply that softer monetary policy increases income inequality."
(Why) Do Central Banks Care about Their Profits?,IGOR GONCHAROV,22 June 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13257,"ABSTRACTWe document that central banks are discontinuously more likely to report slightly positive profits than slightly negative profits, especially when political pressure is greater, the public is more receptive to extreme political views, and central bank governors are eligible for reappointment. The propensity to report small profits over small losses is correlated with higher inflation and lower interest rates. We conclude that there are agency problems at central banks, which give rise to discontinuous profit incentives that correlate with central banks’ policy choices and outcomes. These findings inform the debate about the political economy of central banking and central bank design."
Presidential Address: Sustainable Finance and ESG Issues—Value versus Values,LAURA T. STARKS,19 June 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13255,"ABSTRACTIn this address, I discuss differences across investor and manager motivations for considering sustainable finance—valueversusvaluesmotivations—and how these differences contribute to misunderstandings about environmental, social, and governance investment approaches. The finance research community has the ability and responsibility to help clear up these misunderstandings through additional research, which I suggest."
Rents and Intangible Capital: A Q+ Framework,NICOLAS CROUZET,24 April 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13231,"ABSTRACTIn recent years, U.S. investment has been lackluster, despite rising valuations. Key explanations include growing rents and growing intangibles. We propose and estimate a framework to quantify their roles. The gap between valuations—reflected in averageQ—and investment—reflected in marginalq—can be decomposed into three terms: the value of installed intangibles; rents generated by physical capital; and an interaction term, measuring rents generated by intangibles. The intangible related terms contribute significantly to the gap, particularly in fast-growing sectors. Our findings suggest care in a pure-rents interpretation, given the rising role of intangibles."
Can Security Design Foster Household Risk-Taking?,LAURENT E. CALVET,23 April 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13232,ABSTRACTThis paper shows that securities with nonlinear payoff designs can foster household risk-taking. We demonstrate this effect by exploiting the introduction of capital guarantee products in Sweden between 2002 and 2007. Their fast and broad adoption is associated with an increase in expected financial portfolio returns. The effect is especially strong for households with low-risk appetite ex ante. These empirical facts are consistent with a life-cycle model in which households have pessimistic beliefs or preferences combining loss aversion and narrow framing. Our results illustrate how security design can mitigate behavioral biases to increase mean household portfolio returns.
Modeling Corporate Bond Returns,BRYAN KELLY,24 April 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13233,"ABSTRACTWe propose a conditional factor model for corporate bond returns with five factors and time-varying factor loadings. We have three main empirical findings. First, our factor model excels in describing the risks and returns of corporate bonds, improving over previously proposed models in the literature by a large margin. Second, our model recommends a systematic bond investment portfolio whose high out-of-sample Sharpe ratio suggests that the credit risk premium is notably larger than previously estimated. Third, we find closer integration between debt and equity markets than found in prior literature."
Barter Credit: Warehouses as a Contracting Technology,JANIS SKRASTINS,29 May 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13252,"ABSTRACTA large Brazilian agribusiness lender introduces a new contracting technology: grain warehouses. Using runner-up warehouse locations as a control group, I find that construction of these warehouses permits a new debt contract, namely, barter credit repayable in grain. This contract increases borrowers' debt capacity and reduces borrowing costs. The effects are stronger when grain price risk is higher, for municipalities with weaker courts, and for financially constrained borrowers. These findings are consistent with barter credit reducing financial market imperfections by mitigating borrowers' output price risk."
Specialization in Bank Lending: Evidence from Exporting Firms,DANIEL PARAVISINI,20 June 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13254,"ABSTRACTWe develop a novel approach for measuring bank specialization using granular data on borrower activities and apply it to Peruvian exporters and their banks. We find that borrowers seek credit from banks that specialize in their export destinations, both when expanding exports and when exporting to new countries. Firms experiencing country-specific export demand shocks adjust borrowing disproportionately from specialized banks. Specialized bank credit supply shocks affect exports disproportionately to countries of specialization. Our results demonstrate that firm credit demand is bank- and activity-specific, which reduces banking competition and affects the transmission and amplification of shocks through the banking sector."
Employee Costs of Corporate Bankruptcy,JOHN R. GRAHAM,27 May 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13251,"ABSTRACTAn employee's annual earnings fall by 13% in the first full calendar year after her firm's bankruptcy, and the present value of lost earnings from bankruptcy to six years following bankruptcy is 87% of pre-bankruptcy annual earnings. More worker earnings are lost in thin labor markets and among small firms. Ex ante compensating wage differentials for this “bankruptcy risk” are up to 2% of firm value for a firm whose credit rating falls from AA to BBB, comparable in magnitude to debt tax benefits. Thus, wage premia for expected costs of bankruptcy are sufficiently large to be an important consideration in capital structure decisions."
Optimal Sequential Selling Mechanism and Deal Protections in Mergers and Acquisitions,YI CHEN,05 May 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13235,"ABSTRACTWe study the dynamic profit-maximizing selling mechanism in a merger and acquisitions (M&A) environment with costly bidder entry and without entry fees. Depending on the parameters, the optimal mechanism is implemented by a standard auction or by a two-stage procedure with exclusive offers to one bidder followed by an auction potentially favoring that bidder. The optimal mechanism may involve common deal protections like termination fees, asset lockups, or stock option lockups. Our proposed procedures resemble sales of targets filing Chapter 11 bankruptcy or M&A involving public targets, and they shed light on how to use deal protections in practice."
"Liquidity, Volume, and Order Imbalance Volatility",VINCENT BOGOUSSLAVSKY,24 May 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13248,"ABSTRACTWe examine the dynamics of liquidity using a comprehensive sample of U.S. stocks in the post-decimalization period. Motivated by a continuous-time inventory model, we compute a high-frequency measure of order imbalance volatility to proxy for the inventory risk faced by liquidity providers. We show that high-frequency order imbalance volatility is an important driver of liquidity and explains the often positive time-series relation between spread and volume for large stocks, which seems to run counter to most theoretical models. Furthermore, order imbalance volatility is priced in the cross-section of stock returns."
Is COVID Revealing a Virus in CMBS 2.0?,JOHN M. GRIFFIN,30 March 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13228,"ABSTRACTCommercial loan valuations crucially depend on accurate loan income, but underwritten income on commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) loans is commonly overstated relative to actual property income. Consistent with these differences being originator-specific, income overstatement in CMBS 2.0 deals varies widely and persistently across originators, is priced by originators, is related across property types within an originator, is predictable ex ante, and is accompanied by inflation of past financials. Risk retention and associated regulation had no discernible effect on income overstatement. Originator income overstatement is highly predictive of pre- and COVID-period loan distress. Overall, recent market stresses reveal large systemic differences in underwriting standards across originators."
Competition and Misconduct,JOHN THANASSOULIS,27 March 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13227,"ABSTRACTMisconduct is widespread. Practices such as misselling, pump and dump, and money laundering cause harm while raising profits. This paper presents a mechanism that can determine what sorts of misconduct can be sustained in competitive equilibrium in concentrated markets, oligopoly settings, and markets with many small competing firms. The model studied allows general demand and distinguishes types of ethical dilemma using current psychological understanding. The paper shows, for example, that markets with many small competing firms are not vulnerable to misconduct if firms respond to entry with niche strategies or if the ethical dilemma draws an emotional response."
Reusing Natural Experiments,DAVIDSON HEATH,24 May 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13250,"ABSTRACTAfter a natural experiment is first used, other researchers often reuse the setting, examining different outcome variables. We use simulations based on real data to illustrate the multiple hypothesis testing problem that arises when researchers reuse natural experiments. We then provide guidance for future inference based on popular empirical settings including difference-in-differences, instrumental variables, and regression discontinuity designs. When we apply our guidance to two extensively studied natural experiments, business combination laws and the Regulation SHO pilot, we find that many results that were statistically significant using single hypothesis testing do not survive corrections for multiple hypothesis testing."
Retail Derivatives and Sentiment: A Sentiment Measure Constructed from Issuances of Retail Structured Equity Products,BRIAN J. HENDERSON,27 May 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13253,"ABSTRACTWe use retail structured equity product (SEP) issuances to construct a new sentiment measure for large capitalization stocks. The SEP sentiment measure predicts negative abnormal returns on the SEP reference stocks based on a variety of factor models, and also predicts returns in Fama-MacBeth regressions that include a wide range of covariates. Consistent with our interpretation that SEP issuances reflect investor sentiment, aggregate SEP issuances are highly correlated with the Baker-Wurgler sentiment index. Tobit regressions reveal that proxies for attention and sentiment predict SEP issuance volumes, providing additional evidence consistent with the hypothesis that SEP issuances reflect sentiment."
CLO Performance,LARRY CORDELL,21 March 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13224,"ABSTRACTWe study the performance of collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) to understand the market imperfections giving rise to these vehicles and their corresponding economic costs. CLO equity tranches earn positive abnormal returns from the risk-adjusted price differential between leveraged loans and CLO debt tranches. Debt tranches offer higher returns than similarly rated corporate bonds, making them attractive to banks and insurers that face risk-based capital requirements. Temporal variation in equity performance highlights the resilience of CLOs to market volatility due to their closed-end structure, long-term funding, and embedded options to reinvest principal proceeds."
Pockets of Predictability,LELAND E. FARMER,03 April 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13229,"ABSTRACTFor many benchmark predictor variables, short-horizon return predictability in the U.S. stock market is local in time as short periods with significant predictability (“pockets”) are interspersed with long periods with no return predictability. We document this result empirically using a flexible time-varying parameter model that estimates predictive coefficients as a nonparametric function of time and explore possible explanations of this finding, including time-varying risk premia for which we find limited support. Conversely, pockets of return predictability are consistent with a sticky expectations model in which investors slowly update their beliefs about a persistent component in the cash flow process."
The Pollution Premium,PO-HSUAN HSU,27 February 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13217,"ABSTRACTThis paper studies the asset pricing implications of industrial pollution. A long-short portfolio constructed from firms with high versus low toxic emission intensity within an industry generates an average annual return of 4.42%, which remains significant after controlling for risk factors. This pollution premium cannot be explained by existing systematic risks, investor preferences, market sentiment, political connections, or corporate governance. We propose and model a new systematic risk related to environmental policy uncertainty. We use the growth in environmental litigation penalties to measure regime change risk and find that it helps price the cross section of emission portfolios' returns."
Duration-Driven Returns,NIELS JOACHIM GORMSEN,27 February 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13216,"ABSTRACTWe propose a duration-based explanation for the premia on major equity factors, including value, profitability, investment, low-risk, and payout factors. These factors invest in firms that earn most of their cash flows in the near future and could therefore be driven by a premium on near-future cash flows. We test this hypothesis using a novel data set of single-stock dividend futures, which are claims on dividends of individual firms. Consistent with our hypothesis, the expected Capital Asset Pricing Model alpha on individual cash flows decreases in maturity within a firm, and the alpha is not related to the above characteristics when controlling for maturity."
Firm-Level Climate Change Exposure,ZACHARIAS SAUTNER,28 February 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13219,"ABSTRACTWe develop a method that identifies the attention paid by earnings call participants to firms' climate change exposures. The method adapts a machine learning keyword discovery algorithm and captures exposures related to opportunity, physical, and regulatory shocks associated with climate change. The measures are available for more than 10,000 firms from 34 countries between 2002 and 2020. We show that the measures are useful in predicting important real outcomes related to the net-zero transition, in particular, job creation in disruptive green technologies and green patenting, and that they contain information that is priced in options and equity markets."
Macroeconomic News in Asset Pricing and Reality,GREGORY R. DUFFEE,28 February 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13218,"ABSTRACTRevisions in successive Greenbook forecasts of quarterly real GDP growth proxy for news of current and expected future economic growth. In the sample 1975 through 2015, news of future growth is slightly negatively related to contemporaneous changes in Treasury bond yields, while news of current growth is strongly positively related to changes in these yields. Both results are difficult to reconcile with a representative agent's bondholding first-order condition. A continuous-time dynamic model of output attributes almost all of the covariation with yields to martingale innovations in log output and a minimal amount to innovations in the conditional drift of log output."
Who Owns What? A Factor Model for Direct Stockholding,VIMAL BALASUBRAMANIAM,07 March 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13220,"ABSTRACTWe build a cross-sectional factor model for investors' direct stockholdings and estimate it using data from almost 10 million retail accounts in the Indian stock market. Our model identifies strong investor clienteles for stock characteristics, most notably firm age and share price, and for particular clusters of stock characteristics. These clienteles are intuitively associated with investor attributes such as account age, size, and diversification. Coheld stocks tend to have higher return covariance, inconsistent with simple models of diversification but suggestive that clientele demands influence stock returns."
Integrating Factor Models,DORON AVRAMOV,22 March 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13226,"ABSTRACTThis paper develops a comprehensive framework to address uncertainty about the correct factor model. Asset pricing inferences draw on a composite model that integrates over competing factor models weighted by posterior probabilities. Evidence shows that unconditional models record near-zero probabilities, while postearnings announcement drift, quality-minus-junk, and intermediary capital are potent factors in conditional asset pricing. Out-of-sample, the integrated model performs well, tilting away from subsequently underperforming factors. Model uncertainty makes equities appearconsiderablyriskier, while model disagreement about expected returns spikes during crash episodes. Disagreement spans all return components involving mispricing, factor loadings, and risk premia."
Visibility Bias in the Transmission of Consumption Beliefs and Undersaving,BING HAN,21 March 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13223,"ABSTRACTWe model visibility bias in the social transmission of consumption behavior. When consumption is more salient than nonconsumption, people perceive that others are consuming heavily, and infer that future prospects are favorable. This increases aggregate consumption in a positive feedback loop. A distinctive implication is that disclosure policy interventions can ameliorate undersaving. In contrast with wealth-signaling models, information asymmetry about wealthreducesoverconsumption. The model predicts that saving is influenced by social connectedness, observation biases, and demographic structure, and provides new insight into savings rates. These predictions are distinct from other common models of consumption distortions."
Naïve Buying Diversification and Narrow Framing by Individual Investors,JOHN GATHERGOOD,20 March 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13222,"ABSTRACTWe provide the first tests to distinguish whether individual investors equally balance their overall portfolios (naïve portfolio diversification, NPD) or, in contrast, equally balance the values of same-day purchases of multiple assets (naïvebuyingdiversification, NBD). We find NBD in purchases of multiple stocks, and in mixed purchases of individual stocks and funds. In contrast, there is little evidence of NPD. Evidence suggests that NBD arises due to stock picking behavior and neglect of diversification. These findings suggest that behavioral finance theory should incorporate transaction, as well as portfolio, framing."
Model Comparison with Transaction Costs,ANDREW DETZEL,20 March 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13225,"ABSTRACTFailing to account for transaction costs materially impacts inferences drawn when evaluating asset pricing models, biasing tests in favor of those employing high-cost factors. Ignoring transaction costs, Hou, Xue, and Zhang (2015,Review of Financial Studies, 28, 650–705)q-factor model and Barillas and Shanken (2018,TheJournal of Finance, 73, 715–754) six-factor models have high maximum squared Sharpe ratios and small alphas across 205 anomalies. They do not, however, come close to spanning theachievablemean-variance efficient frontier. Accounting for transaction costs, the Fama and French (2015,Journal of Financial Economics, 116, 1–22; 2018,Journal of Financial Economics, 128, 234–252) five-factor model has a significantly higher squared Sharpe ratio than either of these alternative models, while variations employing cash profitability perform better still."
Did FinTech Lenders Facilitate PPP Fraud?,JOHN M. GRIFFIN,07 February 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13209,"ABSTRACTIn the $793 billion Paycheck Protection Program, we examine metrics related to potential misreporting including nonregistered businesses, multiple businesses at residential addresses, abnormally high implied compensation per employee, and large inconsistencies with jobs reported in another government program. These measures consistently concentrate in certain FinTech lenders and are cross-verified by seven additional measures. FinTech market share increased significantly over time, and suspicious lending by FinTechs in 2021 is four times the level at the start of the program. Suspicious loans are being overwhelmingly forgiven at rates similar to other loans."
Pricing Currency Risks,MIKHAIL CHERNOV,16 November 2022,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13190,"ABSTRACTThe currency market features a small cross-section, and conditional expected returns can be characterized by few signals: interest differential, trend, and mean reversion. We exploit these properties to construct the ex ante mean-variance efficient portfolio of individual currencies. The portfolio is updated in real time and prices all prominent currency trading strategies, conditionally and unconditionally. The fraction of risk in these assets that does not affect their risk premiums is at least 85%. Extant explanations of carry strategies based on intermediary capital or global volatility are related to these unpriced components, while consumption growth is related to the priced component of returns."
A Model of Systemic Bank Runs,XUEWEN LIU,08 February 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13213,"ABSTRACTWe develop a tractable model of systemic bank runs. The market-based banking system features a two-layer structure: banks with heterogeneous fundamentals face potential runs by their creditors while they trade short-term funding in the asset (interbank) market in response to creditor withdrawals. The possibility of a run on a particular bank depends on its assets' interim liquidation value, and this value depends endogenously in turn on the status of other banks in the asset market. The within-bank coordination problem among creditors and the cross-bank price externality feed into each other. A small shock can be amplified into a systemic crisis."
Biased Auctioneers,MATHIEU AUBRY,18 January 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13203,"ABSTRACTWe construct a neural network algorithm that generates price predictions for art at auction, relying on both visual and nonvisual object characteristics. We find that higher automated valuations relative to auction house presale estimates are associated with substantially higher price-to-estimate ratios and lower buy-in rates, pointing to estimates' informational inefficiency. The relative contribution of machine learning is higher for artists with less dispersed and lower average prices. Furthermore, we show that auctioneers' prediction errors are persistent both at the artist and at the auction house level, and hence directly predictable themselves using information on past errors."
Discount-Rate Risk in Private Equity: Evidence from Secondary Market Transactions,BRIAN H. BOYER,15 January 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13202,"ABSTRACTMeasures of private equity (PE) performance based on cash flows do not account for a discount-rate risk premium that is a component of the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) alpha. We create secondary market PE indices and find that PE discount rates vary considerably. Net asset values are too smooth because they fail to reflect variation in discount rates. Although the CAPM alpha for our index is zero, the generalized public market equivalent based on cash flows is large and positive. We obtain similar results for a set of synthetic funds that invest in small cap stocks. Ignoring variation in PE discount rates can lead to a misallocation of capital."
Do Municipal Bond Dealers Give Their Customers “Fair and Reasonable” Pricing?,JOHN M. GRIFFIN,07 February 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13214,"ABSTRACTMunicipal bonds exhibit considerable retail pricing variation, even for same-size trades of the same bond on the same day, and even from the same dealer. Markups vary widely across dealers. Trading strongly clusters on eighth price increments, and clustered trades exhibit higher markups. Yields are often lowered to just above salient numbers. Machine learning estimates exploiting the richness of the data show that dealers that use strategic pricing have systematically higher markups. Recent Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board rules have had only a limited impact on markups. While a subset of dealers focus on best execution, many dealers appear focused on opportunistic pricing."
Information Aggregation via Contracting,JIASUN LI,17 January 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13205,"ABSTRACTWhen a group of investors with dispersed private information jointly invest in a risky project, how should they divide the project's profit? We show that a simple contract dividing profits in proportion to investors' risk tolerances may facilitate information aggregation by altering investors' risk-taking incentives when they decide on how investment strategies respond to private information. Our results provide a contracting-based approach for information aggregation, which is an alternative to learning from endogenous market variables (e.g., prices) via contingent schedules as seen in well-known rational expectations equilibrium models."
Equilibrium Bitcoin Pricing,BRUNO BIAIS,19 January 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13206,"ABSTRACTWe offer a general equilibrium analysis of cryptocurrency pricing. The fundamental value of the cryptocurrency is its stream of net transactional benefits, which depend on its future prices. This implies that, in addition to fundamentals, equilibrium prices reflect sunspots. This in turn implies multiple equilibria and extrinsic volatility, that is, cryptocurrency prices fluctuate even when fundamentals are constant. To match our model to the data, we construct indices measuring the net transactional benefits of Bitcoin. In our calibration, part of the variations in Bitcoin returns reflects changes in net transactional benefits, but a larger share reflects extrinsic volatility."
"Local Experiences, Search, and Spillovers in the Housing Market",ANTONIO GARGANO,06 February 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13208,"ABSTRACTRecent local price growth explains differences in search behavior across prospective homebuyers. Those experiencing higher growth in their postcode of residence search more broadly across locations and house characteristics, without changing attention devoted to individual sales listings, and have shorter search duration. Effects are stronger for homeowners, in particular those living in less wealthy areas and looking for a new primary residence. We use reduced-form analysis and a quantitative equilibrium model to show that the expansion of search breadth translates into widespread spillovers onto house sales prices and inventories of listings across postcodes within a metropolitan area."
Model Secrecy and Stress Tests,YARON LEITNER,04 February 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13207,"ABSTRACTShould regulators reveal the models they use to stress-test banks? In our setting, revealing leads to gaming, but secrecy can induce banks to underinvest in socially desirable assets for fear of failing the test. We show that although the regulator can solve this underinvestment problem by making the test easier, some disclosure may still be optimal (e.g., if banks have high appetite for risk or if capital shortfalls are not very costly). Cutoff rules are optimal within monotone disclosure rules, but more generally optimal disclosure is single-peaked. We discuss policy implications and offer applications beyond stress tests."
The Gender Gap in Housing Returns,PAUL GOLDSMITH-PINKHAM,07 February 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13212,"ABSTRACTUsing detailed transactions data across the United States, we find that single women earn 1.5 percentage points lower annualized returns on housing relative to single men. Forty-five percent of the gap is explained by transaction timing and location. The remaining gap arises from a 2% gender difference in execution prices at purchase and sale. Consistent with a negotiation channel, women list for less and experience worse negotiated discounts. The gender gap shrinks in tight markets, where negotiation is replaced by quasi-auctions. Overall, gender differences in housing explain 30% of the gender gap in wealth accumulation for the median household."
Monetary Stimulus amidst the Infrastructure Investment Spree: Evidence from China's Loan-Level Data,KAIJI CHEN,18 January 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13204,"ABSTRACTWe study how a fiscal expansion via infrastructure investment influences the dynamic impacts of monetary stimulus on credit allocation. We develop a two-stage approach and apply it to the Chinese economy with a confidential loan-level data set that covers all sectors. We find that infrastructure investment significantly weakened monetary policy's transmission to credit allocated to private firms, while reinforcing the monetary effects on loans to state-owned firms. This fiscal-monetary interaction channel is key to understanding the preferential credit access enjoyed by state-owned firms during the stimulus period. Consequently, monetary stimulus crowded out private investment and decreased capital allocation efficiency."

Optimal Financial Transaction Taxes,EDUARDO DÁVILA,07 November 2022,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13188,"ABSTRACTThis paper characterizes the optimal transaction tax in an equilibrium model of financial markets. If investors hold heterogeneous beliefs unrelated to their fundamental trading motives and the planner calculates welfare using any single belief, a positive tax is optimal, regardless of the magnitude of fundamental trading. Under some conditions, the optimal tax is independent of the planner's belief. The optimal tax can be implemented by adjusting its value until total volume equals fundamental volume. Knowledge of (i) the share of nonfundamental trading volume and (ii) the semielasticity of trading volume to tax changes is sufficient to quantify the optimal tax."
"Less Mainstream Credit, More Payday Borrowing? Evidence from Debt Collection Restrictions",JULIA FONSECA,14 November 2022,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13189,"ABSTRACTGovernments regulate debt collectors to protect consumers from predatory practices. These restrictions may lower repayment, reducing the supply of mainstream credit and increasing demand for alternative credit. Using individual credit record data and a difference-in-differences design comparing consumers in states that tighten restrictions on debt collection to those in neighboring states that do not, I find that restricting collections reduces access to mainstream credit and increases payday borrowing. These findings provide new evidence of substitution between alternative and mainstream credit and point to a trade-off between shielding consumers from certain collection practices and pushing them into higher cost payday lending markets."
Disruption and Credit Markets,BO BECKER,08 November 2022,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13187,"ABSTRACTWe show that over the past half-century, innovative disruptions were central to understanding corporate defaults. In a given year, industries experiencing abnormally high venture capital or initial public offering activity subsequently see higher default rates, higher segment exits by conglomerates, and higher yields on bonds issued by the firms in these industries. Overall, we find that disruption is a broad phenomenon, negatively affecting incumbent firms across the spectrum of age, valuation, and levers, with the exception of very large and low-leverage firms, in line with our central hypothesis."
How Risky Are U.S. Corporate Assets?,TETIANA DAVYDIUK,11 December 2022,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13196,"ABSTRACTWe use market data on corporate bonds and equities to measure the value of U.S. corporate assets and their payouts to investors. In contrast to equity dividends, total corporate payouts are highly volatile, turn negative when corporations raise capital, and are acyclical. At the same time, corporate asset returns are similar to returns on equity, and both are exposed to fluctuations in economic growth. To reconcile this evidence, we argue that acyclical but volatile net repurchases mask the exposure of total payouts' cash components to economic growth risks. We develop an asset pricing framework to quantitatively illustrate this economic channel."
International Yield Curves and Currency Puzzles,MIKHAIL CHERNOV,16 November 2022,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13191,"ABSTRACTThe currency depreciation rate is often computed as the ratio of foreign to domestic pricing kernels. Using bond prices alone to estimate these kernels leads to currency puzzles: the inability of models to match violations of uncovered interest parity and the volatility of exchange rates. This happens because of theFX bond disconnect, the inability of bonds to span exchange rates. Incorporating innovations to the pricing kernel that affect exchange rates but not bonds helps resolve the puzzles. This approach also allows one to relate news about cross-country differences between international yields to news about currency risk premiums."
Decentralization through Tokenization,MICHAEL SOCKIN,23 November 2022,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13192,"ABSTRACTWe examine decentralization of digital platforms through tokenization as an innovation to resolve the conflict between platforms and users. By delegating control to users, tokenization through utility tokens acts as a commitment device that prevents a platform from exploiting users. This commitment comes at the cost of not having an owner with an equity stake who, in conventional platforms, would subsidize participation to maximize the platform's network effect. This trade-off makes utility tokens a more appealing funding scheme than equity for platforms with weak fundamentals. The conflict reappears when nonusers, such as token investors and validators, participate on the platform."
Beyond Basis Basics: Liquidity Demand and Deviations from the Law of One Price,TODD M. HAZELKORN,12 December 2022,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13198,"ABSTRACTDeviations from the law of one price between futures and spot prices—the futures-cash basis—capture information about liquidity demand for equity market exposure in global markets. We show that the basis comoves with dealer and investor futures positions, is contemporaneously positively correlated with futures and spot market returns, and negatively predicts futures and spot returns. These findings are consistent with the futures-cash basis reflecting liquidity demand that is common to futures and cash equity markets. We find persistent supply-demand imbalances for equity index exposure reflected in the basis, giving rise to an annual premium of 5% to 6%."
Principal Portfolios,BRYAN KELLY,14 December 2022,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13199,"ABSTRACTWe propose a new asset pricing framework in which all securities' signals predict each individual return. While the literature focuses on securities' own-signal predictability, assuming equal strength across securities, our framework includes cross-predictability—leading to three main results. First, we derive the optimal strategy in closed form. It consists of eigenvectors of a “prediction matrix,” which we call “principal portfolios.” Second, we decompose the problem into alpha and beta, yielding optimal strategies with, respectively, zero and positive factor exposure. Third, we provide a new test of asset pricing models. Empirically, principal portfolios deliver significant out-of-sample alphas to standard factors in several data sets."
Small Business Equity Returns: Empirical Evidence from the Business Credit Card Securitization Market,MATTHIAS FLECKENSTEIN,20 December 2022,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13200,ABSTRACTWe present a new approach for estimating small business equity returns. This approach applies the Merton (1974) credit model to the returns on entrepreneurial business credit card debt securitizations and solves for the implied equity returns for the small businesses owned by the cardholders. The estimated small business equity premium is 10.74%. The standard deviation of small business equity returns is 56.37%. We validate the methodology by applying it to investment-grade corporate bonds and recovering a public equity premium of 6.17%.
Beliefs Aggregation and Return Predictability,ALBERT S. KYLE,10 December 2022,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13195,"ABSTRACTWe study return predictability using a model of speculative trading among competitive traders who agree to disagree about the precision of private information. Although traders apply Bayes' Law consistently, returns are predictable. In addition to trading on long-term fundamental value, traders also trade on perceived short-term opportunities arising from foreseen future disagreement, as in a Keynesian beauty contest. Contradicting conventional wisdom, this short-term speculation dampens price fluctuations and generates time-series momentum. Model calibration shows quantitatively realistic patterns of return dynamics. Consistent with empirical evidence, our model predicts more pronounced momentum for stocks with higher trading volume."
Bayesian Solutions for the Factor Zoo: We Just Ran Two Quadrillion Models,SVETLANA BRYZGALOVA,10 December 2022,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13197,"ABSTRACTWe propose a novel framework for analyzing linear asset pricing models: simple, robust, and applicable to high-dimensional problems. For a (potentially misspecified) stand-alone model, it provides reliable price of risk estimates for both tradable and nontradable factors, and detects those weakly identified. For competing factors and (possibly nonnested) models, the method automatically selects the best specification—ifa dominant one exists—or provides a Bayesian model averaging–stochastic discount factor (BMA-SDF), if there is no clear winner. We analyze 2.25 quadrillion models generated by a large set of factors and find that the BMA-SDF outperforms existing models in- and out-of-sample."
Presidential Address: Macrofinance and Resilience,MARKUS K. BRUNNERMEIER,11 November 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13403,"ABSTRACTThis address reviews macrofinance from the perspective of resilience. It argues for a shift in mindset, away from risk management toward resilience management. It proposes a new resilience measure, and contrasts micro- and macro-resilience. It also classifies macrofinance models in first- (log-linearized) and second-generation models, and links the important themes of macrofinance to resilience."
"Mortgage Lock-In, Mobility, and Labor Reallocation",JULIA FONSECA,20 October 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13398,"ABSTRACTWe study the impact of rising mortgage rates on mobility and labor reallocation. Using individual-level credit record data and variation in the timing of mortgage origination, we show that a 1 percentage point decline in the difference between mortgage rates locked in at origination and current rates reduces moving by 9% overall and 16% between 2022 and 2024, and this relationship is asymmetric. Mortgage lock-in also dampens flows in and out of self-employment and the responsiveness to shocks to nearby employment opportunities that require moving, measured as wage growth within a 50- to 150-mile ring and instrumented with a shift-share instrument."
Financial Sophistication and Consumer Spending,ADAM TEJS JØRRING,17 October 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13393,"ABSTRACTUsing detailed account-level data, this paper explores how financial sophistication affects consumers' spending responses to changes in income. I document that, controlling for liquidity, financially unsophisticated consumers display significant spending responses to predictable decreases in their disposable income. Furthermore, they have lower savings rates, fewer liquid savings, and higher debt-to-income ratios, leaving them more exposed to income shocks. Robustness tests, supported by anecdotal survey evidence, indicate that these results are driven by some consumers' lack of financial sophistication and their consequent failure to understand their financial contracts, rather than by random idiosyncratic shocks, rational liquidity management, or optimal inattention."
"Time-Consistent Individuals, Time-Inconsistent Households",ANDREW HERTZBERG,16 October 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13392,"ABSTRACTI present a model of consumption and savings for a multiperson household in which members are imperfectly altruistic, derive utility from both private and shared public goods, and share wealth. I show that, despite having standard exponential time preferences, the household is time-inconsistent: Members save too little and overspend on private consumption goods. The household remains time-inconsistent even when members save separately, because the possibility of voluntary transfers or joint contribution to the public good preserves the dynamic commons problem. The household will choose to share wealth when the risk-sharing benefits outweigh the utility cost of overconsumption."
A Multifactor Perspective on Volatility-Managed Portfolios,VICTOR DeMIGUEL,27 October 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13395,"ABSTRACTMoreira and Muir question the existence of a strong risk-return trade-off by showing that investors can improve performance by reducing exposure to risk factors when their volatility is high. However, Cederburg et al. show that these strategies fail out-of-sample, and Barroso and Detzel show they do not survive transaction costs. We propose a conditional multifactor portfolio that outperforms its unconditional counterpart even out-of-sample and net of costs. Moreover, we show that factor risk prices generally decrease with market volatility. Our results demonstrate that the breakdown of the risk-return trade-off is more puzzling than previously thought."
Bonds versus Equities: Information for Investment,HUIFENG CHANG,20 October 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13396,"ABSTRACTWe provide a simple model of investment by a firm funded with debt and equity and empirical evidence to demonstrate that, once we control for the debt overhang problem with credit spreads,assetvolatility is an unambiguouslypositivesignal for investment, whileequityvolatility sends a mixed signal: Elevated volatility raises the option value of equity and increases investment for financially sound firms, but exacerbates debt overhang and decreases investment for firms close to default. Our study provides a simple unified understanding of the structural and empirical relationships between investment, credit spreads, equity versus asset volatility, leverage, and Tobin'sq$q$."
Putting the Price in Asset Pricing,THUMMIM CHO,09 October 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13391,"ABSTRACTWe propose a novel way to estimate a portfolio'sabnormal price, the percentage gap between price and the present value of dividends computed with a chosen asset pricing model. Our method, based on a novel identity, resembles the time-series estimator of abnormal returns, avoids the issues in alternative approaches, and clarifies the role of risk and mispricing in long-horizon returns. We apply our techniques to study the cross-section of price levels relative to the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) and find that a single characteristic,adjusted value, provides a parsimonious model of CAPM-implied abnormal price."
Liquidity Transformation and Fragility in the U.S. Banking Sector,QI CHEN,13 October 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13390,"ABSTRACTLiquidity transformation, a key role of banks, is thought to increase fragility, as uninsured depositors face an incentive to withdraw money before others (a so-called panic run). Despite much theoretical work, however, there is little empirical evidence establishing this mechanism. In this paper, we provide the first large-scale evidence of this mechanism. Banks that engage in more liquidity transformation exhibit higher fragility, as captured by stronger sensitivities of uninsured deposit flows to bank performance and greater levels of uninsured deposit outflows when performance is poor. We also explore the effects of deposit insurance and systemic risk."
Currency Management by International Fixed-Income Mutual Funds,CLEMENS SIALM,25 August 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13381,"ABSTRACTInvestments in international fixed-income securities are exposed to significant currency risks. We collect novel data on currency derivatives used by U.S. international fixed-income funds. We document that while 90% of funds use currency forwards, they hedge, on average, only 18% of their currency exposure. Funds' currency forward positions differ substantially based on risk management demands related to portfolio currency exposure, return-enhancement motives such as currency momentum and carry trade, and strategic considerations related to past performance and fund clientele. Funds that hedge their currency risk exhibit lower return variability, but do not generate inferior abnormal returns."
Treasury Bill Shortages and the Pricing of Short-Term Assets,ADRIEN D'AVERNAS,26 August 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13376,"ABSTRACTWe propose a model of post-Great Financial Crisis (GFC) money markets and monetary policy implementation. In our framework, capital regulation may deter banks from intermediating liquidity derived from holding reserves to shadow banks. Consequently, money markets can be segmented, and the scarcity of Treasury bills available to shadow banks is the main driver of short-term spreads. In this regime, open market operations have an inverse effect on net liquidity provision when swapping ample reserves for scarce T-bills or repos. Our model quantitatively accounts for post-2010 time series for repo rates, T-bill yields, and the Fed's reverse repo facility usage."
Equity Term Structures without Dividend Strips Data,STEFANO GIGLIO,24 October 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13394,"ABSTRACTWe use a large cross section of equity returns to estimate a rich affine model of equity prices, dividends, returns, and their dynamics. Our model prices dividend strips of the market and equity portfolios without using strips data in the estimation. Yet model-implied equity yields closely match yields on traded strips. Our model extends equity term-structure data over time (to the 1970s) and across maturities, and generates term structures for various equity portfolios. The novel cross section of term structures from our model covers 45 years and includes several recessions, providing a novel set of empirical moments to discipline asset pricing models."
Utility Tokens as a Commitment to Competition,ITAY GOLDSTEIN,10 October 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13389,"ABSTRACTWe show that utility tokens can limit the rent-seeking activities of two-sided platforms with market power while preserving efficiency gains due to network effects. We model platforms where buyers and sellers can meet to exchange services. Tokens serve as the sole medium of exchange on a platform and can be traded in a secondary market. Tokenizing a platform commits a firm to give up monopolistic rents associated with the control of the platform, leading to long-run competitive prices. We show how the threat of entrants can incentivize developers to tokenize and discuss cases where regulation is needed to enforce tokenization."
The Working Capital Credit Multiplier,HEITOR ALMEIDA,27 August 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13385,"ABSTRACTWe provide novel evidence that funding frictions can limit firms’ short-term investments in receivables and inventories, reducing their production capacity. We propose a credit multiplier driven by these considerations and empirically isolate its importance by comparing how a similar firm responds to shocks differently when these shocks are initiated in their most profitable quarter (“main quarter”). We implement this test using recurring and unpredictable shocks (e.g., oil shocks) and provide extensive evidence supporting our identification strategy. Our results suggest that funding constraints and credit multiplier effects are significant for smaller firms that heavily rely on financing from suppliers."
Lying to Speak the Truth: Selective Manipulation and Improved Information Transmission,PAUL POVEL,19 August 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13375,"ABSTRACTWe analyze a principal-agent model in which an effort-averse agent can manipulate a publicly observable performance report. The principal cannot observe the agent's cost of effort, her effort choice, and whether she manipulated the report. An optimal contract links compensation to the realized output and the (possibly manipulated) report. Manipulation can be beneficial to the principal because it can make the report more informative about the agent's effort choice, thereby reducing the agent's information rent. This is achieved through a contract that incentivizes the agent to selectively engage in manipulation based on her effort choice."
Did Banks Pay Fair Returns to Taxpayers on TARP?,THOMAS FLANAGAN,24 June 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13367,"ABSTRACTFinancial institutions received investments under the Troubled Asset Relief Program in a bad state of the world but repaid them in a relatively good state. We show that the recipients paid considerably lower returns to taxpayers compared to private-market securities with similar risk over the same investment horizon, resulting in a subsidy of over $50 billion on the preferred equity investment by the government. Ex-post renegotiation of contract terms limited the upside gains received by taxpayers in good times and contributed to the subsidy. These findings have important implications for the design and implementation of future bailouts. Our simple methodology for calculating the subsidy can be applied to evaluate the financial costs of other bailouts."
"Liquidity, Liquidity Everywhere, Not a Drop to Use: Why Flooding Banks with Central Bank Reserves May Not Expand Liquidity",VIRAL V. ACHARYA,05 July 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13370,"ABSTRACTCentral bank balance sheet expansion, through actions like quantitative easing, is run through commercial banks. While this increases liquid central bank reserves held on commercial bank balance sheets, demandable uninsured deposits issued to finance the reserves also increase. Subsequent shrinkage in the central bank balance sheet may entail shrinkage in bank-held reserves without a commensurate reduction in deposit claims. Furthermore, during episodes of liquidity stress, when many claims on liquidity are called, surplus banks may hoard reserves. As a result, central bank balance sheet expansion may create less additional liquidity than typically thought, and indeed, may increase the probability and severity of episodes of liquidity stress."
Bailout Stigma,YEON-KOO CHE,23 August 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13386,"ABSTRACTWe develop a model of bailout stigma in which accepting a bailout signals a firm's balance-sheet weakness and reduces its funding prospects. To avoid stigma, high-quality firms withdraw from subsequent financing after receiving bailouts or refuse bailouts altogether to send a favorable signal. The former leads to a short-lived stimulation followed by a market freeze even worse than if there were no bailout. The latter revives the funding market, albeit with delay, to the level achievable without any stigma and implements a constrained optimal outcome. A menu of multiple bailout programs compounds bailout stigma and exacerbates the market freeze."
The SOE Premium and Government Support in China's Credit Market,ZHE GENG,14 August 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13380,"ABSTRACTStudying China's credit market using a structural default model that integrates credit risk, liquidity, and bailout, we document improved price discovery and a deepening divide between state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and non-SOEs. Amidst liquidity deterioration, the presence of government bailout helps alleviate the heightened liquidity-driven default, making SOE bonds more valuable and widening the SOE premium. Meanwhile, the increased importance of government support makes SOEs more sensitive to bailout, while the heightened default risk increases non-SOEs' sensitivity to credit quality. Examining the real impact, we find severe performance deteriorations of non-SOEs relative to SOEs, reversing the long-standing trend of non-SOEs outperforming SOEs."
Business News and Business Cycles,LELAND BYBEE,09 August 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13377,"ABSTRACTWe propose an approach to measuring the state of the economy via textual analysis of business news. From the full text of 800,000Wall Street Journalarticles for 1984 to 2017, we estimate a topic model that summarizes business news into interpretable topical themes and quantifies the proportion of news attention allocated to each theme over time. News attention closely tracks a wide range of economic activities and can forecast aggregate stock market returns. A text-augmented vector autoregression demonstrates the large incremental role of news text in forecasting macroeconomic dynamics. We retrieve the narratives that underlie these improvements in market and business cycle forecasts."
The Mortgage-Cash Premium Puzzle,MICHAEL REHER,23 July 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13373,"ABSTRACTAll-cash homebuyers account for one-third of U.S. home purchases between 1980 and 2017. We use multiple data sets and research designs to robustly estimate that mortgaged buyers pay an 11% premium over all-cash buyers to compensate home sellers for mortgage transaction frictions. A dynamic, representative-seller model implies only a 3% premium, which would suggest an 8% puzzle. Accounting for heterogeneity in selling conditions explains half of this difference, but a puzzle holds in conditions with high transaction risk. An experimental survey of U.S. homeowners replicates these patterns and suggests that belief distortions can explain the puzzle in these high-risk states."
Unobserved Performance of Hedge Funds,VIKAS AGARWAL,10 July 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13368,"ABSTRACTWe investigate hedge fund firms’ unobserved performance (UP), measured as the risk-adjusted return difference between a firm's reported gross return and its portfolio return inferred from its disclosed long-equity holdings. Firms with high UP outperform those with low UP by 6.36% per annum on a risk-adjusted basis. UP is negatively associated with a firm's trading costs and positively associated with intraquarter trading in equity positions, derivatives usage, short selling, and confidential holdings. We show that limited investor attention can delay investors’ response to UP and lead to longer lived predictability of fund firm performance."
Do Women Receive Worse Financial Advice?,UTPAL BHATTACHARYA,05 July 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13366,"ABSTRACTWe arranged for trained undercover men and women to pose as potential clients and visit all 65 local financial advisory firms in Hong Kong. At financial planning firms, but not at securities firms, women were more likely than men to receive advice to buy only individual or only local securities. Female clients who signaled high confidence, high risk tolerance, or a domestic outlook were especially likely to receive this suboptimal advice. Our theoretical model explains these patterns as a result of statistical discrimination interacting with advisors’ incentives. Taste-based discrimination is unlikely to explain the results."
FinTech Credit and Entrepreneurial Growth,HARALD HAU,30 August 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13384,"ABSTRACTBased on automated credit lines to vendors trading on Alibaba's online retail platform and a discontinuity in the credit decision algorithm, we document that a vendor's access to FinTech credit boosts its sales growth, transaction growth, and the level of customer satisfaction gauged by product, service, and consignment ratings. These effects are more pronounced for vendors characterized by greater information asymmetry about their credit risk and less collateral, which reveals the information advantage of FinTech credit over traditional credit technology."
Founder-CEO Compensation and Selection into Venture Capital-Backed Entrepreneurship,MICHAEL EWENS,22 August 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13383,"ABSTRACTWe show theoretically that a critical determinant of the attractiveness of venture capital (VC)-backed entrepreneurship for high-earning potential founders is the expected time to develop a startup's initial product. This is because founder-CEOs' cash compensation increases substantially after product development, alleviating the nondiversifiable risk that founders face at startup birth. Consistent with the model's predictions of where the supply of entrepreneurial talent is likely to be most constrained, we find that technological shocks differentially altering the expected time to product across industries can explain changes in both the rate of entry and characteristics of individuals selecting into VC-backed entrepreneurship."
Capital Commitment,ELISE GOURIER,27 August 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13382,"ABSTRACTTwelve trillion dollars are allocated to private market funds that require outside investors to commit to transferring capital on demand. We show within a novel dynamic portfolio allocation model that ex-ante commitment has large effects on investors' portfolios and welfare, and we quantify those effects. Investors are underallocated to private market funds and are willing to pay a larger premium to adjust the quantity committed than to eliminate other frictions, like timing uncertainty and limited tradability. Perhaps counterintuitively, commitment risk premiums increase with secondary market liquidity, and they do not disappear when investments are spread over many funds."
The Portfolio-Driven Disposition Effect,LI AN,21 August 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13378,"ABSTRACTThe disposition effect for a stock significantly weakens if the portfolio is at a gain, but is large when it is at a loss. We find this portfolio-driven disposition effect (PDDE) in four independent settings: U.S. and Chinese archival data, as well as U.S. and Chinese experiments. The PDDE is robust to a variety of controls in regression specifications and is not explained by extreme returns, portfolio rebalancing, tax considerations, or investor heterogeneity. Our evidence suggests that investors form mental frames at both the stock and the portfolio levels and that these frames combine to generate the PDDE."
Firm Performance Pay as Insurance against Promotion Risk,ALVIN CHEN,12 August 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13379,"ABSTRACTThe prevalence of pay based on risky firm outcomes for nonexecutive workers presents a puzzling departure from conventional contract theory, which predicts insurance provision by the firm. When workers at the same firm compete against each other for promotions, the optimal contract features pay based on firm outcomes as insurance against promotion risk. The model's predictions are consistent with many observed phenomena, such as performance-based vesting and overvaluation of equity pay by nonexecutive workers. It also generates novel predictions linking a firm's hierarchy to its workers' pay structure."
Anomaly Time,BOONE BOWLES,18 July 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13372,"ABSTRACTWe examine the timing of returns around the publication of anomaly trading signals. Using a database that captures when information is first publicly released, we show that anomaly returns are concentrated in the first month after information release dates, and these returns decay soon thereafter. We also show that the academic convention of forming portfolios in June underestimates predictability because it uses stale information, which makes some anomalies appear insignificant. In contrast, we show many anomalies do predict returns if portfolios are formed immediately after information releases. Finally, we develop guidance on forming portfolios without using stale information."
Very Noisy Option Prices and Inference Regarding the Volatility Risk Premium,JEFFERSON DUARTE,17 July 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13365,"ABSTRACTThe stylized fact that volatility is not priced in individual equity options does not withstand scrutiny. First, we show that the average return of heavily traded deep out-of-the-money call options on stocks is −116 basis points per day. Second, Fama-MacBeth estimates of the volatility risk premium in stock options are similar to those in S&P 500 Index call options. Third, the mean return of heavily traded delta-hedged at-the-money calls (puts) is −23 (−30) basis points. Fourth, the variance risk premium in stock options is negative. Our analysis highlights the importance of microstructure biases and robustness in empirical work with options."
On the Magnification of Small Biases in Hiring,SHAUN WILLIAM DAVIES,18 July 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13374,"ABSTRACTWe analyze a setting in which a board must hire a chief executive officer (CEO) after exerting effort to learn about the quality of each candidate. Optimal effort is asymmetric, implying asymmetric likelihoods of each candidate being chosen. If the board has an infinitesimal bias in favor of one candidate, it allocates effort to maximize the likelihood of that candidate being chosen. Even when the board's prior is that its preferred candidate is inferior, she may still be chosen most often. A glass ceiling can also arise whereby the tendency to hire favored candidates increases as the importance of the position increases."
A (Sub)penny for Your Thoughts: Tracking Retail Investor Activity in TAQ,BRAD M. BARBER,03 May 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13334,"ABSTRACTWe placed 85,000 retail trades in six retail brokerage accounts from December 2021 to June 2022 to validate the Boehmer et al. algorithm, which uses subpenny trade prices to identify and sign retail trades. The algorithm identifies 35% of our trades as retail, incorrectly signs 28% of identified trades, and yields uninformative order imbalance measures for 30% of stocks. We modify the algorithm by signing trades using the quoted spread midpoints. The quote midpoint method does not affect identification rates but reduces the signing error rates to 5% and provides informative order imbalance measures for all stocks."
Spending Less after (Seemingly) Bad News,MARK J. GARMAISE,29 April 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13325,"ABSTRACTUsing high-frequency spending data, we show that household consumption displays excess sensitivity to salient macroeconomic news, even when the news is not real. When the announced local unemployment rate reaches a 12-month maximum, local news coverage of unemployment increases and local consumers reduce their discretionary spending by 1.5% relative to consumers in areas with the same macroeconomic conditions. Low-income households display greater excess sensitivity to salience. The decrease in spending is not later reversed. Households in treated areas act as if they are more financially constrained than those in untreated areas with the same fundamentals."
Insensitive Investors,CONSTANTIN CHARLES,18 June 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13362,"ABSTRACTWe experimentally study the transmission of subjective expectations into actions. Subjects in our experiment report valuations that are far too insensitive to their expectations, relative to the prediction from a frictionless model. We propose that the insensitivity is driven by a noisy cognitive process that prevents subjects from precisely computing asset valuations. The empirical link between subjective expectations and actions becomes stronger as subjective expectations approach rational expectations. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating weak transmission into belief-based asset pricing models. Finally, we discuss how cognitive noise can provide a microfoundation for inelastic demand in the stock market."
Money and Banking with Reserves and CBDC,DIRK NIEPELT,05 June 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13357,"ABSTRACTWe analyze the role of retail central bank digital currency (CBDC) and reserves when banks exert deposit market power and liquidity transformation entails externalities. Optimal monetary architecture minimizes the social costs of liquidity provision, and optimal monetary policy follows modified Friedman rules. Interest rates on reserves and CBDC should differ. Calibrations robustly suggest that CBDC provides liquidity more efficiently than deposits unless the central bank must refinance banks and this is very costly. Accordingly, the optimal share of CBDC in payments tends to exceed that of deposits."
The Time-Varying Price of Financial Intermediation in the Mortgage Market,ANDREAS FUSTER,04 June 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13358,"ABSTRACTWe introduce a new measure of the price charged by financial intermediaries for connecting mortgage borrowers with capital market investors. Based on administrative lender pricing data, we document that the price of intermediation reacts strongly to variation in demand, reflecting capacity constraints of mortgage originators. This positive comovement of price with quantity reduced the pass-through of quantitative easing. We also find a notable upward trend in this price between 2008 and 2014, likely due to increased legal and regulatory burden in the mortgage market. The trend led to an implicit cost to borrowers of nearly $100 billion over this period."
What Drives Variation in the U.S. Debt-to-Output Ratio? The Dogs that Did not Bark,ZHENGYANG JIANG,11 June 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13363,"ABSTRACTA higher U.S. government debt-to-output (D-O) ratio does not forecast higher surpluses or lower returns on Treasurys in the future. Neither future cash flows nor discount rates account for the variation in the current D-O ratio. The market valuation of Treasurys is surprisingly insensitive to macro fundamentals. Instead, the future D-O ratio accounts for most of the variation because the D-O ratio is highly persistent. Systematic surplus forecast errors may help account for these findings. Since the start of the Global Financial Crisis, surplus projections have anticipated a large fiscal correction that failed to materialize."
Inside and Outside Information,DANIEL QUIGLEY,10 June 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13360,"ABSTRACTWe study an economy with financial frictions in which a regulator designs a test that reveals outside information about a firm's quality to investors. The firm can also disclose verifiable inside information about its quality. We show that the regulator optimally aims for “public speech and private silence,” which is achieved with tests that give insiders an incentive to stay quiet. We fully characterize optimal tests by developing tools for Bayesian persuasion with incentive constraints, and use these results to derive novel guidance for the design of bank stress tests, as well as benchmarks for socially optimal corporate credit ratings."
Information Aggregation with Asymmetric Asset Payoffs,ELIAS ALBAGLI,11 June 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13361,"ABSTRACTWe study noisy aggregation of dispersed information in financial markets without imposing parametric restrictions on preferences, information, and return distributions. We provide a general characterization of asset returns by means of a risk-neutral probability measure that features excess weight on tail risks. Moreover, we link excess weight on tail risks to observable moments such as forecast dispersion and accuracy, and argue that it provides a unified explanation for several prominent cross-sectional return anomalies. Simple calibrations suggest the model can account for a significant fraction of empirical returns to skewness, returns to disagreement, and interaction effects between the two."
Half Banked: The Economic Impact of Cash Management in the Marijuana Industry,ELIZABETH A. BERGER,19 June 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13364,"ABSTRACTWe investigate the economic value of cash management. In the legal marijuana industry, where only half of businesses have access to cash management services from a financial institution, we examine dispensary profitability using administrative and survey data. Our results show that businesses with cash management charge higher retail prices (8.3%), pay lower wholesale prices (7.3%), and have higher sales volume (19%). Together, these advantages create a 40% increase in profitability. These results support our model in which reputational capital and administrative costs drive profitability regardless of whether national banks, credit unions, or fintech provide the cash management functions."
Treasury Richness,MATTHIAS FLECKENSTEIN,16 July 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13371,"ABSTRACTWe provide estimates of Treasury convenience premia across the entire term structure of Treasury bills, notes, and bonds over more than a quarter of a century and document a variety of key stylized facts about their time-series and cross-sectional patterns. These results raise concerns about the evolving nature of Treasury markets and suggest that investors may now place less weight on the traditional role of Treasury securities as liquid trading vehicles. These stylized facts provide empirical benchmarks that could help guide future theoretical and empirical work about the economics of safe assets in financial markets."
Meeting Targets in Competitive Product Markets,EMILIO BISETTI,24 June 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13369,"ABSTRACTWe show that public banks face negative stock return jumps after missing their earnings per share (EPS) targets, and theoretically and quantitatively link these jumps to bunching behavior in the EPS surprise distribution. Bunching banks cut deposit rates to meet their targets, but do so at the expense of deposit outflows and franchise value losses. Local competitors, including private banks unexposed to capital market pressure, increase deposit rates, compensating depositors for switching. Our results provide new evidence that performance targeting incentives can affect consumer product prices, and suggest that competition may provide a check on public firms' targeting efforts."
Is Long-Run Risk Really Priced? Revisiting Liu and Matthies (2022),PAULO MAIO,22 April 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13340,"ABSTRACTThe claim by Liu and Matthies (LM) that their macro news risk factor (NI) prices 51 portfolios (associated with four different portfolio groups) is not appropriate. In fact, their single-factor model is successful only in explaining the momentum deciles, while producing strongly negative performance for the remaining groups. The pricing performance is more doubtful in the case of the alternative news factor (HNI), as the respective risk price is not identified. LM's conclusions stem from a combination of questionable empirical choices and misinterpretation of their results. Moreover, the NI model cannot explain prominent capital asset pricing model anomalies not considered in their study."
Monetary Policy and Asset Price Overshooting: A Rationale for the Wall/Main Street Disconnect,RICARDO J. CABALLERO,12 April 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13343,"ABSTRACTWe analyzeoptimalmonetary policy and its implications for asset prices when aggregate demand has inertia. If there is a negative output gap, the central bank optimally overshoots aggregate asset prices (above their steady-state levels consistent with current potential output). Overshooting leads to a temporary disconnect between the performance of financial markets and the real economy, but accelerates the recovery. When there is a lower bound constraint on the discount rate, good macroeconomic news is better news for asset prices when the output gap is more negative. Finally, we document that during the COVID-19 recovery, the policy-induced overshooting was large."
Countercyclical Income Risk and Portfolio Choices: Evidence from Sweden,SYLVAIN CATHERINE,08 April 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13341,"ABSTRACTUsing Swedish administrative panel data, we document that workers facing higher left-tail income risk when equity markets perform poorly have lower portfolio equity share. In line with theory, the relationship between cyclical skewness and stock holdings increases with the share of human capital in a worker's total wealth and vanishes as workers get closer to retirement. Cyclical skewness also predicts portfolio differences within pairs of identical twins. Our findings show that households hedge against correlated tail risks, an important mechanism in asset pricing and portfolio choice models."
Tracing the International Transmission of a Crisis through Multinational Firms,MARCUS BIERMANN,08 April 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13338,"ABSTRACTWe show that multinational firms transmit shocks across countries through their internal capital markets. We study a credit supply shock to parent firms in Germany. International affiliates outside Germany supported their parents through internal lending, became financially constrained themselves, and experienced lower real growth. We find that managers were “Darwinist” with respect to international affiliates but “Socialist” in the home country, that internal capital markets transmitted the credit shock more strongly than a nonfinancial shock, and that access to developed credit markets attenuated the real effects. The total real impact of shock transmission through multinationals on foreign economies was large."
A Horizon-Based Decomposition of Mutual Fund Value Added Using Transactions,JULES VAN BINSBERGEN,04 April 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13331,"ABSTRACTWe decompose mutual fund value added by the length of funds' holdings using transaction-level data. We motivate our decomposition with a model featuring horizon-specific investment ideas, where short-term ideas are less scalable because the associated trades cannot be spread over time. Fund turnover correlates negatively with the horizon over which value is added and positively with price impact costs. As predicted, holdings of high-turnover funds add a substantial amount of value in the first two weeks, of which more than 80% is earned on Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and earnings announcement days. Holdings of low-turnover funds add value only over longer horizons."
Zombie Credit and (Dis-)Inflation: Evidence from Europe,VIRAL V. ACHARYA,11 April 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13342,"ABSTRACTWe show that “zombie credit”—subsidized credit to nonviable firms—has a disinflationary effect. By keeping these firms afloat, zombie credit creates excess aggregate supply, thereby putting downward pressure on prices. Granular European data on inflation, firms, and banks confirm this mechanism. Markets affected by a rise in zombie credit experience lower firm entry and exit, capacity utilization, markups, and inflation, as well as a misallocation of capital and labor, which results in lower productivity, investment, and value added. If weakly capitalized banks were recapitalized in 2009, inflation in Europe would have been up to 0.21 percentage points higher post-2012."
Goal Setting and Saving in the FinTech Era,ANTONIO GARGANO,11 April 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13339,"ABSTRACTWe study the effectiveness of saving goals in increasing individuals' savings using data from a Fintech app. Using a difference-in-differences identification strategy that randomly assigns users into a group of beta testers who can set goals and a group of users who cannot, we find that setting goals increases individuals' savings rate. The increased savings within the app do not reduce savings outside the app. Moreover, goal setting helps those individuals previously identified as having the lowest propensity to save. Matching App user survey responses to their behavior highlights the relative merits of monitoring and concreteness channels in explaining our findings."
Rent or Buy? Inflation Experiences and Homeownership within and across Countries,ULRIKE MALMENDIER,19 April 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13332,"ABSTRACTWe show that past inflation experiences strongly predict homeownership within and across countries. First, we collect novel survey data, which reveal inflation protection to be a key motivation for homeownership, especially after high inflation experiences. Second, using household data from 22 European countries, we find that higher exposure to historical inflation predicts higher homeownership rates. We estimate similar associations among immigrants to the United States who experienced different past inflation in their home countries but face the same U.S. housing market. Consistent with the experience effects model, the relationship is strongest in countries with predominantly fixed-rate mortgages."
A Portfolio Approach to Global Imbalances,ZHENGYANG JIANG,09 April 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13333,"ABSTRACTWe use a portfolio-based framework to understand what drives the decline of the U.S. net foreign asset (NFA) position and the reversal in returns earned on the U.S. NFA (exorbitant privilege). We show that global savings gluts and monetary policies widened the U.S. NFA position, while investor demand shifts partially offset this widening. Moreover, U.S. privilege declined after 2010, in line with increasing foreign demand for U.S. equity. We also highlight a quantity dimension of the U.S. privilege: The U.S. can issue substantially more debt than other countries for a given yield increase."
The Term Structure of Covered Interest Rate Parity Violations,PATRICK AUGUSTIN,31 March 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13336,"ABSTRACTWe quantify the impact of risk-based and nonrisk-based intermediary constraints (IC) on the term structure of covered interest rate parity (CIP) violations. Using a stochastic discount factor (SDF) inferred from interest rate swaps, we value currency derivatives. The wedge between model-implied and observed derivative prices reflects the impact of nonrisk-based IC because our SDF incorporates risk-based IC. There is no wedge at short horizons, while the wedge accounts for 40% of long-term CIP violations. Consistent with IC theory, the wedge correlates with the shadow cost of intermediary capital, and the SDF-implied interest rate is a weighted average of collateralized and uncollateralized interest rates."
Due Diligence,BRENDAN DALEY,04 March 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13322,"ABSTRACTWe propose a model of due diligence and analyze its effect on prices, payoffs, and deal completion. In our model, if the seller accepts an offer, the winning bidder (or “acquirer”) can gather information and chooses when to complete the transaction. In equilibrium, the acquirer engages in “too much” due diligence. Our quantitative results suggest that the magnitude of the distortion is economically significant. Nevertheless, allowing for due diligence can improve both total surplus and the seller's payoff compared to a setting without due diligence. We use our framework to explore the timing of due diligence, bidder heterogeneity, and breakup fees."
Broadband Internet and the Stock Market Investments of Individual Investors,HANS K. HVIDE,17 April 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13335,"ABSTRACTWe study the effects of broadband internet use on the investment decisions of individual investors. A public program in Norway provides plausibly exogenous variation in internet use. Our instrumental variables estimates show that internet use causes a substantial increase in stock market participation, driven primarily by increased fund ownership. Existing investors tilt their portfolios toward funds, thereby obtaining more diversified portfolios and higher Sharpe ratios, and do not increase their trading activity in stocks. Overall, access to high-speed internet spurs a “democratization of finance,” with individuals making investment decisions that are more in line with the advice from portfolio theory."
"Mergers, Product Prices, and Innovation: Evidence from the Pharmaceutical Industry",ALICE BONAIMÉ,01 March 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13321,"ABSTRACTUsing novel data from the pharmaceutical industry, we study product prices and innovation around mergers. Exploiting within-deal variation in product market consolidation, we show that prices increase more for drugs in consolidating markets than for matched control drugs. Estimates indicate a 2% average price effect that persists for about one year. Price increases expand with acquirer-target product similarity and are more pronounced within less competitive product markets with fewer players and no generic competition. Examination of trade-offs reveals these deals generate significant shareholder value. They also spur labeling and other manufacturing-related innovation, but not the development of new drugs."
Does Alternative Data Improve Financial Forecasting? The Horizon Effect,OLIVIER DESSAINT,07 March 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13323,"ABSTRACTExisting research suggests that alternative data are mainly informative about short-term future outcomes. We show theoretically that the availability of short-term-oriented data can induce forecasters to optimally shift their attention from the long term to the short term because it reduces the cost of obtaining short-term information. Consequently, the informativeness of their long-term forecasts decreases, even though the informativeness of their short-term forecasts increases. We test and confirm this prediction by considering how the informativeness of equity analysts' forecasts at various horizons varies over the long run and with their exposure to social media data."
Modeling Conditional Factor Risk Premia Implied by Index Option Returns,MATHIEU FOURNIER,08 March 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13324,"ABSTRACTWe propose a novel factor model for option returns. Option exposures are estimated nonparametrically, and factor risk premia can vary nonlinearly with states. The model is estimated using regressions with minimal assumptions on factor and option return dynamics. We estimate the model using index options to characterize the conditional risk premia for factors of interest, such as the market return, market variance, tail and intermediary risk factors, higher moments, and the VIX term structure slope. Together, market return and variance explain more than 90% of option return variation. Unconditionally, the magnitude of the variance risk premium is plausible. It displays pronounced time variation, spikes during crises, and always has the expected sign."
Nonstandard Errors,ALBERT J. MENKVELD,17 April 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13337,"ABSTRACTIn statistics, samples are drawn from a population in a data-generating process (DGP). Standard errors measure the uncertainty in estimates of population parameters. In science, evidence is generated to test hypotheses in an evidence-generating process (EGP). We claim that EGP variation across researchers adds uncertainty—nonstandard errors (NSEs). We study NSEs by letting 164 teams test the same hypotheses on the same data. NSEs turn out to be sizable, but smaller for more reproducible or higher rated research. Adding peer-review stages reduces NSEs. We further find that this type of uncertainty is underestimated by participants."
Political Polarization Affects Households' Financial Decisions: Evidence from Home Sales,W. BEN MCCARTNEY,11 February 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13315,"ABSTRACTPolitical identity and partisanship are salient features of today's society. Using deeds records and voter rolls, we show that current residents are more likely to sell their homes when opposite-party neighbors move in nearby than when unaffiliated or same-party neighbors do. This is especially true when the new neighbors are politically active, consistent with an animosity between parties mechanism. We conclude that affective polarization is not limited to purely political settings and affects one of the household's most important financial decisions, their home transactions."
Measuring “Dark Matter” in Asset Pricing Models,HUI CHEN,03 March 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13317,"ABSTRACTWe formalize the concept of “dark matter” in asset pricing models by quantifying the additional informativeness of cross-equation restrictions about fundamental dynamics. The dark-matter measure captures the degree of fragility for models that are potentially misspecified and unstable: a large dark-matter measure indicates that the model lacks internal refutability (weak power of optimal specification tests) and external validity (high overfitting tendency and poor out-of-sample fit). The measure can be computed at low cost even for complex dynamic structural models. To illustrate its applications, we provide quantitative examples applying the measure to (time-varying) rare-disaster risk and long-run risk models."
Informed Trading Intensity,VINCENT BOGOUSSLAVSKY,27 February 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13320,"ABSTRACTWe train a machine learning method on a class of informed trades to develop a new measure of informed trading, informed trading intensity (ITI). ITI increases before earnings, mergers and acquisitions, and news announcements, and has implications for return reversal and asset pricing. ITI is effective because it captures nonlinearities and interactions between informed trading, volume, and volatility. This data-driven approach can shed light on the economics of informed trading, including impatient informed trading, commonality in informed trading, and models of informed trading. Overall, learning from informed trading data can generate an effective informed trading measure."
How Integrated are Credit and Equity Markets? Evidence from Index Options,PIERRE COLLIN-DUFRESNE,12 December 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13300,"ABSTRACTWe study the extent to which credit index (CDX) options are priced consistent with S&P 500 (SPX) equity index options. We derive analytical expressions for CDX and SPX options within a structural credit-risk model with stochastic volatility and jumps using new results for pricing compound options via multivariate affine transform analysis. The model captures many aspects of the joint dynamics of CDX and SPX options. However, it cannot reconcile the relative levels of option prices, suggesting that credit and equity markets are not fully integrated. A strategy of selling CDX volatility yields significantly higher excess returns than selling SPX volatility."
Dissecting the Long-Term Performance of the Chinese Stock Market,FRANKLIN ALLEN,01 March 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13312,"ABSTRACTDomestically listed Chinese (A-share) firms have lower stock returns than externally listed Chinese, developed, and emerging country firms during 2000 to 2018. They also have lower net cash flows than matched unlisted Chinese firms. The underperformance of both stock and accounting returns is more pronounced for large A-share firms, while small firms show no underperformance along either dimension. Investor sentiment explains low stock returns in the cross-country and within-A-share samples. Institutional deficiencies in listing and delisting processes and weak corporate governance in terms of shareholder value creation are consistent with the underperformance in stock returns and net cash flows."
The Narrow Channel of Quantitative Easing: Evidence from YCC Down Under,DAVID O. LUCCA,18 December 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13307,"ABSTRACTWe study the recent Australian experience with yield curve control (YCC) as perhaps the best evidence of how this policy might work in other developed economies. YCC seemingly worked well in 2020, when the market expected short rates to stay at zero for a long period of time. As the global recovery and inflation gained momentum in 2021, liftoff expectations moved up, the Reserve Bank of Australia purchased most of the targeted government bond outstanding, and the target bond's yield dislocated from other financial market instruments. The evidence suggests that central bank bond purchase programs can operate more narrowly than previously considered."
Overconfidence and Preferences for Competition,ERNESTO REUBEN,13 February 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13314,"ABSTRACTWe study when preferences for competition are a positive economic trait among high earners and the extent to which this trait can explain the gender gap in income among a master's degree in business administration (MBAs). Consistent with the experimental evidence, preferences for competition are a positive economic trait only for individuals who are not overconfident. Preferences for competition correlate with income only at graduation when bonuses are guaranteed and not a function of performance. Overconfident competition-loving MBAs observe lower compensation and income growth, and experience greater exit from high-reward industries and more frequent job interruptions. Preferences for competition do not explain the gender pay gap among MBAs."
Disclosing a Random Walk,ILAN KREMER,13 November 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13290,"ABSTRACTWe examine a dynamic disclosure model in which the value of a firm follows a random walk. Every period, with some probability, the manager learns the firm's value and decides whether to disclose it. The manager maximizes the market perception of the firm's value, which is based on disclosed information. In equilibrium, the manager follows a threshold strategy with thresholds below current prices. He sometimes reveals pessimistic information that reduces the market perception of the firm's value. He does so to reduce future market uncertainty, which is valuable even under risk-neutrality."
A q Theory of Internal Capital Markets,MIN DAI,24 February 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13318,"ABSTRACTWe propose a tractable model of dynamic investment, spinoffs, financing, and risk management for a multidivision firm facing costly external finance. Our analysis formalizes the following insights: (i) Within-firm resource allocation is based not only on divisions' productivity, as in winner-picking models, but also their risk; (ii) firms may voluntarily spin off productive divisions to increase liquidity; (iii) diversification can reduce firm value in low-liquidity states, as it increases the spinoff cost and hampers liquidity management; (iv) corporate socialism makes liquidity less valuable; and (v) division investment is determined by the ratio between marginaland marginal value of cash."
Fee Variation in Private Equity,JULIANE BEGENAU,23 February 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13319,"ABSTRACTWe study how investment fees vary within private equity funds. Net-of-fee return clustering suggests that most funds have two tiers of fees, and we decompose differences across tiers into both management- and performance-based fees. Managers of venture capital funds and those in high demand are less likely to use multiple fee schedules. Some investors consistently pay lower fees relative to others within their funds. Investor size, experience, and past performance explain some but not all of this effect, suggesting that unobserved traits like negotiation skill or bargaining power materially impact the fees that investors pay to access private markets."
Aversion to Student Debt? Evidence from Low-Wage Workers,RADHAKRISHNAN GOPALAN,08 December 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13297,"ABSTRACTWe combine state minimum wage changes with individual-level income and credit data to estimate the effect of wage gains on the debt of low-wage workers. In the three years following a $0.88 minimum wage increase, low-wage workers experience a $2,712 income increase and a $856 decrease in debt. The entire decline in debt comes from less student loan borrowing among enrolled college students. Credit constraints, buffer-stock behavior, and other rational channels cannot explain the reduction in student debt. Our results are consistent with students perceiving a utility cost of borrowing student debt arising from mental accounting."
The Equilibrium Size and Value-Added of Venture Capital,FRANCESCO SANNINO,14 February 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13313,"ABSTRACTI model positive sorting of entrepreneurs across the high and low value-added segments of the venture capital market. Aiming to attract high-quality entrepreneurs, inefficiently many venture capitalists (VCs) commit to provide high value-added by forming small portfolios. This draws the marginal entrepreneur away from the low value-added segment, reducing match quality in the high value-added segment too. There is underinvestment. Multiple equilibria may emerge, and they differ in aggregate investment. The model rationalizes evidence on VC returns and value-added along fundraising “waves” and when the cost of entrepreneurship falls, and generates untested predictions on the size and value-added of venture capital."
Auctions with Endogenous Initiation,ALEXANDER S. GORBENKO,02 November 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13288,"ABSTRACTWe study initiation of takeover auctions by potential buyers and the seller. A bidder's indication of interest reveals that she is optimistic about the target. If bidders' values have a substantial common component, as in takeover battles between financial bidders, this effect disincentivizes bidders from indicating interest, and auctions are seller-initiated. Conversely, in private-value auctions, such as battles between strategic bidders, equilibria can feature both seller- and bidder-initiated auctions, with the likelihood of the latter decreasing in commonality of values and the probability of a forced sale by the seller. We also relate initiation to bids and auction outcomes."
The Dark Side of Circuit Breakers,HUI CHEN,23 February 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13310,"ABSTRACTMarket-wide circuit breakers are trading halts aimed at stabilizing the market during dramatic price declines. Using an intertemporal equilibrium model, we show that a circuit breaker significantly alters market dynamics and affects investor welfare. As the market approaches the circuit breaker, price volatility rises drastically, accelerating the chance of triggering the circuit breaker—the so-called “magnet effect,” returns exhibit increasing negative skewness, and trading activity spikes up. Our empirical analysis supports the model's predictions. Circuit breakers can affect overall welfare negatively or positively, depending on the relative significance of investors' trading motives for risk sharing versus irrational speculation."
Lender Automation and Racial Disparities in Credit Access,SABRINA T. HOWELL,11 December 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13303,"ABSTRACTProcess automation reduces racial disparities in credit access by enabling smaller loans, broadening banks' geographic reach, and removing human biases from decision making. We document these findings in the context of the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), where private lenders faced no credit risk but decided which firms to serve. Black-owned firms obtained PPP loans primarily from automated fintech lenders, especially in areas with high racial animus. After traditional banks automated their loan processing procedures, their PPP lending to Black-owned firms increased. Our findings cannot be fully explained by racial differences in loan application behaviors, preexisting banking relationships, firm performance, or fraud rates."
Disclosing to Informed Traders,SNEHAL BANERJEE,08 December 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13296,"ABSTRACTWe develop a model in which a firm's manager can voluntarily disclose to privately informed investors. In equilibrium, the manager only discloses sufficiently favorable news. If the manager is known to be informed but disclosure is costly, the probability of disclosure increases with market liquidity and the stock trades at a discount relative to expected cash flows. However, when investors are uncertain about whether the manager is informed, disclosure can decrease with market liquidity and the stock can trade at a premium relative to expected cash flows. Moreover, contrary to common intuition, public information cancrowd inmore voluntary disclosure."
Leverage Is a Double-Edged Sword,AVANIDHAR SUBRAHMANYAM,15 February 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13316,"ABSTRACTWe use proprietary data on intraday transactions at a futures brokerage to analyze how implied leverage influences trading performance. Across all investors, leverage is negatively related to performance, due partly to increased trading costs and partly to forced liquidations resulting from margin calls. Defining skill out-of-sample, we find that relative performance differentials across unskilled and skilled investors persist. Unskilled investors' leverage amplifies losses from lottery preferences and the disposition effect. Leverage stimulates liquidity provision by skilled investors, and enhances returns. Although regulatory increases in required margins decrease skilled investors' returns, they enhance overall returns, and attenuate return volatility."
Choosing to Disagree: Endogenous Dismissiveness and Overconfidence in Financial Markets,SNEHAL BANERJEE,18 February 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13311,"ABSTRACTThe psychology literature documents that individuals derive current utility from their beliefs about future events. We show that, as a result, investors in financial markets choose to disagree about both private information and price information. When objective price informativeness is low, each investor dismisses the private signals of others and ignores price information. In contrast, when prices are sufficiently informative, heterogeneous interpretations arise endogenously: most investors ignore prices, while the rest condition on it. Our analysis demonstrates how observed deviations from rational expectations (e.g., dismissiveness, overconfidence) arise endogenously, interact with each other, and vary with economic conditions."
Report of the Editor of The Journal of Finance for the Year 2023,ANTOINETTE SCHOAR,15 March 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13329,
Front-Page News: The Effect of News Positioning on Financial Markets,ANASTASSIA FEDYK,01 November 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13287,"ABSTRACTThis paper estimates the effect of news positioning on the speed of price discovery, using exogenous variation in prominent (“front-page”) positioning of news articles on the Bloomberg terminal. Front-page articles see 240% higher trading volume and 176% larger absolute excess returns during the first 10 minutes after publication than equally important non-front-page articles. Overall, the information in front-page articles is fully incorporated into prices within an hour of publication. The response to non-front-page information of similar importance eventually converges but takes more than two days to be fully reflected in prices."
The Decline of Secured Debt,EFRAIM BENMELECH,18 December 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13308,"ABSTRACTThe share of secured debt issued (as a fraction of total corporate debt) declined steadily in the United States over the twentieth century. This stems partly from financial development giving creditors greater confidence that high-quality borrowers will respect their claims even if creditors do not obtain security upfront. Consequently, such borrowers prefer retaining financial flexibility by not giving security up front. Instead, security is given contingently—when a firm approaches distress. This also explains why, superimposed on the secular decline, the share of secured debt issued is countercyclical."
Liquidation Value and Loan Pricing,FRANCESCA BARBIERO,03 November 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13291,"ABSTRACTThis paper shows that the liquidation value of collateral depends on the interdependency between borrower and collateral risk. Using transaction-level data on short-term repurchase agreements (repo), we show that borrowers pay a premium of 1.1 to 2.6 basis points when their default risk is positively correlated with the risk of the collateral that they pledge. Moreover, we show that borrowers internalize this premium when making their collateral choices. Loan-level credit registry data suggest that the results extend to the corporate loan market as well."
Neglected Risks in the Communication of Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities Offerings,HAROLD H. ZHANG,13 September 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13278,"ABSTRACTExamining the contractual disclosures during the sale of private-label residential mortgage-backed securities before the 2008 financial crisis, we find that textual contents in the risk-factor section predict subsequent losses and yet were not reflected in pricing. Insurance companies, especially life insurers and insurers with low regulatory capital ratios, are more exposed to textual risks. Consistent with issuers hedging litigation risks with disclosure, we find that textual contents are associated with second-lien underreporting and preissuance written communications. Overall, we find that investors neglected risks in the purportedly safe assets before the crisis."
Interest Rate Skewness and Biased Beliefs,MICHAEL BAUER,13 September 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13276,"ABSTRACTConditional skewness of Treasury yields is an important indicator of the risks to the macroeconomic outlook. Positive skewness signals upside risk to interest rates during periods of accommodative monetary policy and an upward-sloping yield curve, and vice versa. Skewness has substantial predictive power for future bond excess returns, high-frequency interest rate changes around Federal Open Market Committee announcements, and survey forecast errors for interest rates. The estimated expectational errors, or biases in beliefs, are quantitatively important for statistical bond risk premia. These findings are consistent with a heterogeneous-beliefs model in which one of the agents is wrong about consumption growth."
Financing the Gig Economy,GREG BUCHAK,02 November 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13292,"ABSTRACTUnlike traditional firm production, gig economy workers provide their own physical capital. As a consequence, the low-income households for whom gig economy opportunities are most valuable often borrow to participate. In the context of ride share, difference-in-difference analysis reveals increased vehicle purchases, borrowing, utilization, and employment around entry, but financially constrained individuals cannot participate. To assess the equilibrium importance of financing, I build and estimate a structural model of the gig economy. Access to finance proves critical for the gig economy's growth: without finance, equilibrium quantities would be 40% lower and prices 90% higher, and only higher-income households could participate as drivers."
Trading and Shareholder Democracy,DORON LEVIT,03 November 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13289,"ABSTRACTWe study shareholder voting in a model in which trading affects the composition of the shareholder base. Trading and voting are complementary, which gives rise to self-fulfilling expectations about proposal acceptance and multiple equilibria. Prices and shareholder welfare can move in opposite directions, so the former may be an invalid proxy for the latter. Relaxing trading frictions can reduce welfare because it allows extreme shareholders to gain more weight in voting. Delegating decision-making to the board can help overcome collective action problems at the voting stage. We also analyze the role of index investors and social concerns of shareholders."
Legal Risk and Insider Trading,MARCIN KACPERCZYK,11 December 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13299,"ABSTRACTDo illegal insiders internalize legal risk? We address this question with hand-collected data from 530 SEC (the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) investigations. Using two plausibly exogenous shocks to expected penalties, we show that insiders trade less aggressively and earlier and concentrate on tips of greater value when facing a higher risk. The results match the predictions of a model where an insider internalizes the impact of trades on prices and the likelihood of prosecution and anticipates penalties in proportion to trade profits. Our findings lend support to the effectiveness of U.S. regulations' deterrence and the long-standing hypothesis that insider trading enforcement can hamper price informativeness."
Intervention with Screening in Panic-Based Runs,LIN SHEN,03 November 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13295,"ABSTRACTPolicymakers frequently use guarantees to mitigate panic-based runs in the financial system. We analyze a binary-action coordination game under the global games framework and propose a novel intervention program that screens investors based on their heterogeneous beliefs about the system's stability. The program only attracts investors who are at the margin of running, and their participation boosts all investors' confidence in the financial system. Compared with government guarantee programs, our proposed program is as effective at mitigating runs but features two advantages: it costs less to implement and it is robust to moral hazard."
The Global Impact of Brexit Uncertainty,TAREK A. HASSAN,02 November 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13293,"ABSTRACTWe propose a text-based method for measuring the cross-border propagation of large shocks at the firm level. We apply this method to estimate the expected costs, benefits, and risks of Brexit and find widespread reverberations in listed firms in 81 countries. International (i.e., non-U.K.) firms most exposed to Brexituncertainty(the second moment) lost significant market value and reduced hiring and investment. International firms also overwhelmingly expected negative first-moment impacts from the U.K.'s decision to leave the European Union (EU), particularly related to regulation, asset prices, and labor market impacts of Brexit."
The Virtue of Complexity in Return Prediction,BRYAN KELLY,08 December 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13298,"ABSTRACTMuch of the extant literature predicts market returns with “simple” models that use only a few parameters. Contrary to conventional wisdom, we theoretically prove that simple models severely understate return predictability compared to “complex” models in which the number of parameters exceeds the number of observations. We empirically document the virtue of complexity in U.S. equity market return prediction. Our findings establish the rationale for modeling expected returns through machine learning."
"Prestige, Promotion, and Pay",DANIEL FERREIRA,11 December 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13301,"ABSTRACTWe develop a theory in which financial (and other professional services) firms design career structures to “sell” prestigious jobs to qualified candidates. Firms create less prestigious entry-level jobs, which serve as currency for employees to pay for the right to compete for the more prestigious jobs. In optimal career structures, entry-level employees (“associates”) compete for better-paid and more prestigious positions (“managing directors” or “partners”). The model provides new implications relating job prestige to compensation, employment, competition, and the size of the financial sector."
Foreign Exchange Fixings and Returns around the Clock,INGOMAR KROHN,18 December 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13306,"ABSTRACTThe U.S. dollar appreciates in the run-up to foreign exchange (FX) fixes and depreciates thereafter, tracing aW-shaped return pattern around the clock. Return reversals for the top nine traded currencies over a 21-year period are pervasive and highly statistically significant, and they imply daily swings of more than one billion U.S. dollars based on spot volumes. Using natural experiments, we document the existence of a published reference rate determines the timing of intraday return reversals. We present evidence consistent with an inventory risk explanation whereby FX dealers intermediate unconditional demand for U.S. dollars at the fixes."
Information Cascades and Threshold Implementation: Theory and an Application to Crowdfunding,LIN WILLIAM CONG,05 November 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13294,"ABSTRACTEconomic interactions often involve sequential actions, observational learning, and contingent project implementation. We incorporate all-or-nothing thresholds in a canonical model of information cascades. Early supporters effectively delegate their decisions to a “gatekeeper,” resulting in unidirectional cascades without herding on rejections. Project proposers can consequently charge higher prices. Proposal feasibility, project selection, and information aggregation all improve, even when agents can wait. Equilibrium outcomes depend on crowd size, and project implementation and information aggregation achieve efficiency in the large-crowd limit. Our key insights hold under thresholds in dollar amounts and alternative equilibrium selection, among other model extensions."
"Artificial Intelligence, Education, and Entrepreneurship",MICHAEL GOFMAN,12 December 2023,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13302,"ABSTRACTWe document an unprecedented brain drain of Artificial Intelligence (AI) professors from universities from 2004 to 2018. We find that students from the affected universities establish fewer AI startups and raise less funding. The brain-drain effect is significant for tenured professors, professors from top universities, and deep-learning professors. Additional evidence suggests that unobserved city- and university-level shocks are unlikely to drive our results. We consider several economic channels for the findings. The most consistent explanation is that professors' departures reduce startup founders' AI knowledge, which we find is an important factor for successful startup formation and fundraising."
Presidential Address: Housing Betas,MONIKA PIAZZESI,17 October 2025,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.70000,"ABSTRACTThis paper documents new stylized facts about returns and cashflow growth rates on stocks and housing over decade-long holding periods. While cashflow growth rates on the two assets comove positively, their returns comove negatively until the Global Financial Crisis and positively thereafter. These facts present a puzzle for representative-agent models that imply positive return comovement for assets with similar cashflows. I consider a heterogeneous-agent model with segmented stock and housing markets connected through credit. News about the aggregate economy generates negative return comovement. Recent shifts such as wealthier homebuyers and institutional housing purchases reduce the importance of credit and segmentation."
The Credit Line Channel,DANIEL L. GREENWALD,27 August 2025,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13486,"ABSTRACTAggregate U.S. bank lending to firms expanded following the outbreak of COVID-19. Using loan-level supervisory data, we show that this expansion was driven by draws on credit lines by large firms. Banks that experienced larger credit line drawdowns restricted term lending more, crowding out credit to smaller firms, which reacted by reducing investment. A structural model calibrated to match our empirical results shows that while credit lines increase total bank credit in bad times, they redistribute credit from firms with high propensities to invest to firms with low propensities to invest, exacerbating the decrease in aggregate investment."
The Imperfect Intermediation of Money-Like Assets,JEREMY C. STEIN,14 October 2025,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13500,"ABSTRACTWe study supply-and-demand effects in the U.S. Treasury bill market by comparing the returns on T-bills to the policy rate on the Federal Reserve's reverse repurchase (RRP) facility. We develop and test a simple model where the RRP-bill spread is policed both by heterogeneously elastic money funds and by corporate treasurers who derive collateral benefits from holding T-bills. In response to shifts in T-bill supply, money funds act as front-line arbitrageurs. However, when T-bills become extremely scarce, less elastic corporate treasurers become the marginal investors and supply shifts have a larger effect on T-bill rates."
The Stock Market and Bank Risk-Taking,ANTONIO FALATO,06 October 2025,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13502,"ABSTRACTUsing confidential supervisory risk ratings, we document that banks increase risk after going public compared to a control group of banks that filed to go public but withdrew their filings for plausibly exogenous reasons. The increase in risk improves short-term performance at the expense of long-term performance. We argue that the increase in risk stems from pressure to maximize short-term stock prices and earnings once the bank is publicly traded. After going public, banks owned by investors that place greater value on short-term performance increase risk more, and those managed by CEOs with more short-term compensation also increase risk more."
Going for Broke: Bank Reputation and the Performance of Opaque Securities,ABE DE JONG,06 October 2025,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13503,"ABSTRACTCan banks’ reputational concerns improve the quality of opaque, off-balance sheet securities, such as mortgage-backed securities? We study this question in a uniquely parsimonious setting. In the 1760s, Dutch banking partnerships securitized West-Indian plantation mortgages that were risky and opaque. High-reputation banks originated better mortgages and issued securities that, on average, retained 17.5% more of their value during a market collapse. Reputational effects are attenuated when the managing partners were married into wealth or received a large share of profits in the short term, suggesting that bank reputation only works if bankers are personally exposed to (long-run) reputational losses."
The Propagation of Cyberattacks through the Financial System: Evidence from an Actual Event,ANTONIS KOTIDIS,27 August 2025,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13475,"ABSTRACTThis article quantifies the effects of a multiday cyberattack that forced offline a technology service provider (TSP) to the banking sector. The attack impaired customers’ ability to send payments through the TSP, but the business continuity plans of banks and the TSP reduced the effect by more than half. Large banks performed better. Through contagion, banks not directly exposed to the attack experienced a liquidity shortfall, causing them to borrow funds or tap reserves. The ability to send payments after hours helped avoid further contagion. These results highlight the importance of preparedness by the private and official sector for cyberattacks."
Impediments to the Schumpeterian Process in the Replacement of Large Firms,MARA FACCIO,20 August 2025,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13481,"ABSTRACTWe use newly assembled data overall encompassing up to 75 countries and starting circa 1910, to study impediments to the Schumpeterian process of creative destruction as it “proceeds by competitively destroying old businesses.” Political connections appear to represent an obstacle to the destructive part of the Schumpeterian process in the replacement of large firms. When accompanied by regulations that restrict entry, political connections can play a role in allowing large firms to remain large. When connected to Fogel, Morck, and Yeung (2008,Journal of Financial Economics89, 83–108), the results imply that political connections, combined with barriers to entry, can retard economic development."
"CEO Stress, Aging, and Death",MARK BORGSCHULTE,07 October 2025,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13497,"ABSTRACTWe assess the long-term effects of managerial stress on aging and mortality. Using a difference-in-differences design, we apply neural network–based machine-learning techniques to CEOs' facial images and show that exposure to industry distress shocks during the Great Recession produces visible signs of aging. We estimate a one-year increase in “apparent” age. Moreover, using data on CEOs since the mid-1970s, we estimate a 1.1-year decrease in life expectancy after an industry distress shock, but a two-year increase when antitakeover laws insulate CEOs from market discipline. The estimated health costs are significant, both in absolute terms and relative to other health risks."
Privacy and Team Incentives,ANDREA M. BUFFA,15 October 2025,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13496,"ABSTRACTReal-world contracts are typically private, observed only by their direct signatories, so agents working together are vulnerable to the principal opportunistically reducing other agents' incentives. The principal can mitigate this commitment problem by giving the most skilled agent a budget and delegating authority to write other agents' contracts. This endogenous hierarchy, never optimal with public contracts, raises effort, output, and compensation but allows rent extraction. The principal prefers it when contracts are opaque enough, skill is sufficiently heterogeneous across agents, and joint output is sensitive enough to effort. Our model provides novel predictions for the structure of banking syndicates."
"ESG News, Future Cash Flows, and Firm Value",FRANÇOIS DERRIEN,30 September 2025,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13498,"ABSTRACTWe investigate the expected consequences of negative environmental, social, and governance (ESG) news on firms' future profits. After learning about negative ESG news, analysts significantly downgrade their forecasts at short and longer horizons. Negative ESG news affects forecasts more strongly at longer horizons than other types of negative corporate news. The negative revisions of earnings forecasts following negative ESG news largely reflect expectations of lower future sales, rather than higher future costs. Quantitatively, forecast revisions can explain most of the negative impacts of ESG news on firm value. Analysts are correct to revise forecasts downward following negative ESG news."
Green Window Dressing,GIANPAOLO PARISE,29 September 2025,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13499,"ABSTRACTThis paper establishes that mutual funds strategically time their trades in environmental, social, and governance (ESG) stocks around disclosure dates to inflate their sustainability ratings. This claim is supported by three empirical findings. First, we show that funds' ESG betas increase shortly before disclosure and decrease shortly afterwards. Second, we document that post-disclosure fund returns are higher but have lower ESG exposure than disclosed portfolios. Third, we provide evidence that ESG stock prices temporarily rise before disclosure and decline afterwards. Overall, we establish that green window dressing positively impacts fund sustainability ratings, performance, and flows."
War Discourse and the Cross Section of Expected Stock Returns,DAVID HIRSHLEIFER,01 September 2025,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13482,"ABSTRACTA war-related factor model derived from textual analysis of media news reports explains the cross section of expected stock returns. Using a semisupervised topic model to extract discourse topics from 7,000,000New York Timesstories spanning 160 years, the war factor predicts the cross section of returns across test assets derived from both traditional and machine learning construction techniques, and spanning 138 anomalies. Our findings are consistent with assets that are good hedges for war risk receiving lower risk premia, or with assets that are more positively sensitive to war prospects being more overvalued. The return premium on the war factor is incremental to standard effects."
Anomalies and Their Short-Sale Costs,DMITRIY MURAVYEV,30 September 2025,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13501,"ABSTRACTShort-sale costs eliminate the abnormal returns on asset pricing anomaly portfolios. While many anomalies persist out-of-sample before accounting for short-sale costs, they cannot be exploited with long-short strategies due to stock borrow fees. Using a comprehensive sample of 162 anomalies, the average long-short portfolio return is a significant 0.14% per month before short-sale costs, and the returns are due to the short leg. However, the average is −0.01% once returns are adjusted for borrow fees. Moreover, anomalies are not profitable even before fees if the high-fee observations, representing 12% of stock dates, are excluded from the analysis."
Long-Horizon Exchange Rate Expectations,LUKAS KREMENS,29 September 2025,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13504,"ABSTRACTWe study exchange rate expectations in surveys of financial professionals and find that they successfully forecast currency appreciation at the two-year horizon, both in and out of sample. Exchange rate expectations are also interpretable, in the sense that three macro-finance variables—the risk-neutral covariance between the exchange rate and equity market, the real exchange rate, and the current account relative to GDP—explain most of their variation. There is no “secret sauce,” however, in expectations: After controlling for the three macro-finance variables, the residual information in survey expectations does not forecast currency appreciation in our sample."
Value without Employment,SIMCHA BARKAI,07 October 2025,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13505,"ABSTRACTYoung firms' contribution to aggregate employment has been underwhelming. We show that a similar trend is not apparent, however, in their contribution to aggregate sales or stock market capitalization, implying that these firms have exhibited a high average-to-marginal revenue product of labor. We study the implications of a gradual shift in the average-to-marginal revenue product of labor within a model of dynamic firm heterogeneity. We show that this shift provides (i) a unified explanation for several aspects of the decline in dynamism and (ii) a possible explanation for why large declines in young-firm employment may have only a moderate effect on aggregate output and consumption."
Pockets of Predictability: A Replication,NUSRET CAKICI,25 August 2025,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13484,"ABSTRACTFarmer, Schmidt, and Timmermann (FST) document time-variation in market return predictability, identifying “pockets” of significant predictability through kernel regressions. However, our analysis reveals a critical discrepancy between the method outlined by FST and the code actually implemented. Instead of using a one-sided kernel, which guarantees out-of-sample forecasts, they perform in-sample estimation with a two-sided kernel. As a result, future information leaks into the forecasting model, undermining its reliability. Rectifying this error qualitatively alters the findings, invalidating most conclusions of the FST study. Thus, attempts to exploit such “pockets”—should they exist—offer little help in forecasting market returns."

Forest through the Trees: Building Cross-Sections of Stock Returns,SVETLANA BRYZGALOVA,02 September 2025,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13477,"ABSTRACTWe build cross-sections of asset returns for a given set of characteristics, that is, managed portfolios serving as test assets, as well as building blocks for tradable risk factors. We use decision trees to endogenously group similar stocks together by selecting optimal portfolio splits to span the stochastic discount factor, projected on individual stocks. Our portfolios are interpretable and well diversified, reflecting many characteristics and their interactions. Compared to combinations of dozens (even hundreds) of single/double sorts, as well as machine-learning prediction-based portfolios, our cross-sections are low-dimensional yet have up to three times higher out-of-sample Sharpe ratios and alphas."
The “Actual Retail Price” of Equity Trades,CHRISTOPHER SCHWARZ,25 July 2025,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13467,"ABSTRACTWe compare execution quality of six brokerage accounts across five brokers by generating a sample of 85,000 simultaneous market orders. Commission levels and payment for order flow (PFOF) differ across our accounts. We find that execution prices vary significantly across brokers: the mean account-level round-trip cost ranges from 0.07% to 0.46%, excluding any commissions. The dispersion is due to off-exchange wholesalers systematically giving different execution prices for the same trades to different brokers. Across brokers, variation in PFOF does not explain the large variation in price execution. We provide several suggestions for more informative disclosures on execution quality."
Segmented Arbitrage,EMIL N. SIRIWARDANE,04 August 2025,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13469,"ABSTRACTWe use arbitrage activity in equity, fixed income, and foreign exchange markets to characterize the frictions and constraints facing intermediaries. The average pairwise correlation between the 32 arbitrage spreads that we study is 22%. These low correlations are inconsistent with canonical intermediary asset pricing models. We show that at least two types of segmentation drive arbitrage dynamics. First, funding is segmented—certain trades rely on specific funding sources, making their arbitrage spreads sensitive to localized funding shocks. Second, balance sheets are segmented—intermediaries specialize in certain trades, so arbitrage spreads are sensitive to idiosyncratic balance-sheet shocks."
Arbitrage Capital of Global Banks,ALYSSA ANDERSON,18 August 2025,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13478,"ABSTRACTWe study the impact of the U.S. money market fund reform implemented in October 2016 on global banks' funding supply and business activities. We show that the reform induced a large negative wholesale funding shock for global banks. In contrast to the conventional bank lending channel, the primary response of global banks to the reform was a cutback in arbitrage positions that relied on unsecured funding, rather than a reduction in loan provision. We discuss the role of postcrisis liquidity regulations and unconventional monetary policy in explaining our findings, and implications for banks' business models and deposit competition."
Persuading Investors: A Video-Based Study,ALLEN HU,14 August 2025,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13471,"ABSTRACTPersuasive communication functions through not only content but also delivery—facial expression, tone of voice, and diction. This paper examines the persuasiveness of delivery in startup pitches. Using machine learning algorithms to process full pitch videos, we quantify persuasion in visual, vocal, and verbal dimensions. We find that positive (i.e., passionate, warm) pitches increase funding probability. However, conditional on funding, startups with higher levels of pitch positivity underperform. Women are more heavily judged on delivery when evaluated in single-gender teams, but they are neglected when copitching in mixed-gender teams. Using an experiment, we show that persuasion delivery works mainly through leading investors to form inaccurate beliefs."
Does Saving Cause Borrowing? Implications for the Coholding Puzzle,PAOLINA C. MEDINA,02 July 2025,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13466,"ABSTRACTUsing an experiment in which 3.1 million bank customers were encouraged to save, we explore the mechanisms behind coholding liquid savings and credit card debt. Theoretically, we show that the joint responses of spending, saving, and borrowing to the nudge differ across economic models of coholding. Using machine learning techniques, we find that the most responsive individuals reduce spending and increase savings by 4.9% (206 USD PPP per month) while their credit card debt remains unchanged. These individuals' marginal responses to the nudge are consistent with our model of coholding for the purpose of self- or partner-control."
Household Portfolios and Retirement Saving over the Life Cycle,JONATHAN A. PARKER,12 August 2025,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13473,"ABSTRACTUsing account-level data on millions of U.S. middle-class investors over 2006 to 2018, we characterize the share of investable wealth that they hold in the stock market over their working lives. Relative to the 1990s, this share has both risen by 10% and become age-dependent. The Pension Protection Act (PPA)—which allowed target date funds (TDFs) to be default options in retirement plans—played an important role: younger (older) workers starting at a firm after TDFs became the default option post-PPA invested more (less) in stocks, in line with the TDF glidepath. In contrast, contribution rates changed little following the PPA."
Investor Factors,SEBASTIEN BETERMIER,07 August 2025,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13474,"ABSTRACTThis paper develops an empirical methodology for extracting pricing factors from investor portfolio data. We apply this approach to the stockholdings of Norwegian individual investors from 1997 to 2017. A two-factor model, featuring the market portfolio and a long-short portfolio constructed from the holdings of investors sorted by age or wealth, explains both the common variation in portfolio holdings and the cross section of stock returns. Portfolio tilts toward the long-short investor factor correlate with indebtedness, macroeconomic exposure, gender, and investment experience. Our paper illustrates the benefits of using holdings data for explaining the risk premia of financial assets."
Over-the-Counter Markets for Nonstandardized Assets,YOSHIO NOZAWA,26 August 2025,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13483,"ABSTRACTWe study a search and bargaining model of over-the-counter markets for nonstandardized assets of heterogeneous quality. Once matched, investors privately learn their values positively correlated with asset quality. Bargaining results in delay that is hump-shaped in quality and U-shaped in asset turnover. We document these patterns in commercial real estate and corporate bonds markets. Extreme qualities are little affected by changes in asset standardization, while intermediate qualities are more susceptible. For nonstandardized assets, opacity ensures active trading of all assets, which explains why their trading is decentralized and suggests that trade centralization should come with greater standardization."
The Impact of the Financial Education of Executives on the Financial Practices of Medium and Large Enterprises,CLÁUDIA CUSTÓDIO,18 August 2025,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13476,"ABSTRACTWe study the impact of an MBA-style executive education course in finance on corporate policies and firm performance targeting top managers of medium and large Mozambican enterprises. Using a randomized controlled trial, we find that the educational treatment induces changes in financial policies that improve firm performance. Specifically, a reduction in working capital (0.4 to 0.5 standard deviations) increases cash flow, and in turn long-term investments. This effect operates primarily through a reduction in accounts receivable (0.4 to 1 standard deviations). Our findings show that targeted educational interventions can build managerial capital and enhance corporate performance by improving financial decision making among executives."
"Too Much, Too Soon, for Too Long: The Dynamics of Competitive Executive Compensation",GILLES CHEMLA,30 July 2025,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13470,"ABSTRACTWe examine executive compensation in a general equilibrium model with dynamic moral hazard, where executives' outside options are endogenously determined by equilibrium market compensation. Firms provide incentives through compensation packages featuring deferred payments as “carrots” and termination as “sticks.” Crucially, the effectiveness of termination as an incentive device is undermined by the outside options available to executives. As individual firms fail to internalize the effect of their compensation design on these endogenous outside options, the equilibrium is generally inefficient. Compared to shareholder-value-maximizing compensation packages, executives are paid too much, too soon, and keep their jobs for too long."
Thirty Years of Change: The Evolution of Classified Boards,SCOTT GUERNSEY,22 August 2025,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13485,"ABSTRACTBased on a comprehensive data set of classified (staggered) boards covering nearly all U.S. public firms from 1991 to 2020, we show that contrary to conventional wisdom, the use of classified boards remains widespread. Moreover, classified board usage over a firm's life cycle depends significantly on the decade the firm matured or year it went public. While classified boards were rarely removed in the 1990s, firms became more likely to declassify as they matured during the following decades. Decreased collective action costs and increased innovation-related investments, institutional ownership, and scrutiny of governance contributed to this more dynamic adjustment."
Baby Booms and Asset Booms: Demographic Change and the Housing Market,MARC FRANCKE,14 August 2025,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13480,"ABSTRACTBased on centuries of data, we demonstrate that demographics have been a major, predictable driver of house prices. High birth rates 25 to 29 (60 to 64) years ago predict declining (rising) rent-price ratios today. This pattern arises from age-concentrated entry into and exit from homeownership affecting house prices, rather than changes in housing consumption that could also impact rents. We provide evidence for possible mechanisms: slow responses of other market participants to shifts in homeownership demand, and geographic segmentation between rental and owner-occupied markets. Evidence for age-dependent demand effects on yields of bonds and stocks is significantly weaker."
Superstar Returns? Spatial Heterogeneity in Returns to Housing,FRANCISCO AMARAL,19 August 2025,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13479,"ABSTRACTThis paper makes the first comprehensive attempt to study within-country heterogeneity of housing returns. We introduce a new city-level data set covering 15 OECD countries over 150 years and show that national housing markets are characterized by systematic spatial variation in housing returns. Total returns in large agglomerations are close to 100 basis points lower per year than in other parts of the same country. Excess returns outside the large cities can be rationalized as compensation for higher risk, especially higher covariance with income growth and lower liquidity. Real estate in diversified large agglomerations is comparatively safe."
Would Order-By-Order Auctions Be Competitive?,THOMAS ERNST,13 May 2025,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13449,"ABSTRACTWe model two methods of executing segregated retail orders: brokers' routing, whereby brokers allocate orders using the market maker's overall performance, and order-by-order auctions, where market makers bid on individual orders, a recent U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission proposal. Order-by-order auctions improve allocative efficiency, but face a winner's curse reducing retail investor welfare, particularly when liquidity is limited. Additional market participants competing for retail orders fail to improve total efficiency and investor welfare when entrants possess information superior to incumbent wholesalers. Our results hold when new entrants are less informed or the information structure differs. We also examine the cross-subsidization of brokers' routing."
Regulating Over-the-Counter Markets,TOMY LEE,30 May 2025,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13461,"ABSTRACTOver-the-counter (OTC) trading thrives despite competition from exchanges. We let OTC dealers cream skim from exchanges in an otherwise standard Glosten and Milgrom framework. Restricting the dealer's ability to cream skim induces “cheap substitution”: some traders exit while others with larger gains from trade enter. Cheap substitution implies trading costs, trade volumes, and market shares are poor policy indicators. In a benchmark case, restricting the dealer raises welfare only if trading cost increases, volume falls, and OTC market share is high. By contrast, the restriction improves welfare when adverse selection risk is low. A simple procedure implements the optimal Pigouvian tax."
Interlocking Directorates and Competition in Banking,GUGLIELMO BARONE,27 May 2025,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13464,"ABSTRACTWe study the effects on corporate loan rates of an unexpected change in the Italian legislation that forbade interlocking directorates between banks. Exploiting multiple firm-bank relationships to fully account for all unobserved heterogeneity, we find that prohibiting interlocks decreased the interest rates of previously interlocked banks by 14 basis points relative to other banks. The effect is stronger for high-quality firms and for loans extended by interlocked banks with a large joint market share. Interest rates on loans from previously interlocked banks become more dispersed. Finally, firms borrowing more from previously interlocked banks expand investment, employment, and sales."
The Value of Bank Lending,THOMAS FLANAGAN,28 May 2025,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13465,"ABSTRACTUsing a novel data set of realized syndicated loan cash flows and a risk-adjustment methodology adapted from the private equity literature, I provide a measure of risk-adjusted returns for bank loan cash flows. Banks, on average, generate 180 basis points in gross risk-adjusted returns and add $75 million of value annually to their loan portfolios. Banks earn higher returns when they lend to financially constrained borrowers, and the risk-adjusted performance of bank loan portfolios exhibits persistence. However, banks require higher risk-adjusted returns when facing their own financing frictions, and shareholders earn nearly zero net risk-adjusted returns once bank staff are compensated for their lending effort. Overall, these findings suggest that banks provide valuable services to mitigate borrowers' financing frictions, and the present value of loan cash flows pays for the costs of providing these services."
Dynamic Banking and the Value of Deposits,PATRICK BOLTON,23 April 2025,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13454,"ABSTRACTWe propose a theory of banking in which banks cannot perfectly control deposit flows. Facing uninsurable loan and deposit shocks, banks dynamically manage lending, wholesale funding, deposits, and equity. Deposits create value by lowering funding costs. However, when the bank is undercapitalized and at risk of breaching leverage requirements, the marginal value of deposits can turn negative as deposit inflows, by raising leverage, increase the likelihood of costly equity issuance. Banks' inability to fully control leverage distinguishes them from nondepository intermediaries. Our model suggests a reevaluation of leverage regulations and offers new perspectives on banking in a low-interest-rate environment."
What Is the Cost of Privatization for Workers?,MARTIN OLSSON,30 May 2025,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13462,"ABSTRACTPrivatization of state-owned enterprises is on the agenda across the globe. Using Swedish data covering two decades, we show that productivity gains and headcount reductions are associated with economic costs for incumbent workers. Workers experience income losses and higher unemployment, but half of the losses are covered by the social safety net. We also find small positive effects on entrepreneurship and cash holdings but no meaningful effects on other labor market, family, health, or household finance outcomes. Productivity improves when the CEO is replaced, and the gains outweigh workers' income declines by a factor of between two and six."
Venture Capital and Startup Agglomeration,JUN CHEN,01 April 2025,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13451,"ABSTRACTThis paper examines venture capital's (VC) role in the geographic clustering of high-growth startups. We exploit a rule change that disproportionately impacted U.S. regions that historically lacked VC financing via a restriction of banks to invest in the asset class. A one-standard-deviation increase in VCs' exposure to the rule led to a 20% decline in fund size and a 10% decrease in the likelihood of raising a follow-on fund. Startups were not wholly cushioned: financing and valuations declined. Startups also moved out of impacted states after the rule change, likely exacerbating existing geographic disparity in entrepreneurship."
Women in Charge: Evidence from Hospitals,KATHARINA LEWELLEN,26 April 2025,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13455,"ABSTRACTThe paper examines the decision-making, compensation, and turnover of female CEOs in U.S. hospitals. Contrary to the literature on lower-ranked executives and directors in public firms, there is no evidence that gender differences in preferences for risk or altruism affect decision-making of hospital CEOs: corporate policies do not shift when women take (or leave) office, and male and female CEOs respond similarly to a major financial shock. However, female CEOs earn lower salaries, face flatter pay-for-performance incentives, and exhibit greater turnover after poor performance. Hospital boards behave as though they perceive female CEOs as less productive."
Are CEOs Rewarded for Luck? Evidence from Corporate Tax Windfalls,MARTINA ANDREANI,09 April 2025,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13448,"ABSTRACTFocusing on the one-off tax gains and losses (i.e., windfalls) associated with the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we reexamine whether CEOs are rewarded for luck. We find that weakly monitored CEOs are compensated for the windfall tax gains but not penalized for the corresponding tax losses. No such pattern is observed for CEOs facing greater pay scrutiny. The pay for windfalls cannot be explained as rewards for CEOs’ efforts, talents, political activities, or as firms sharing their tax gains with all executives. The results are more consistent with rent extraction by CEOs facing weak pay scrutiny."
Creating Controversy in Proxy Voting Advice,ANDREY MALENKO,16 March 2025,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13438,"ABSTRACTWe analyze how a profit-maximizing proxy advisor designs vote recommendations and research reports. The advisor benefits from producing informative, unbiased reports, but only partially informative recommendations, biased against the a priori likely alternative. Such recommendations induce close votes, increasing controversy and thereby the relevance and value of proxy advice. Our results suggest shifting from an exclusive emphasis on recommendations, highlighting the importance of both reports and recommendations in proxy advisors' information provision. They rationalize the one-size-fits-all approach and help reinterpret empirical patterns of voting behavior, suggesting that proxy advisors' recommendations may not be a suitable benchmark for evaluating shareholders' votes."
Is the United States a Lucky Survivor? A Hierarchical Bayesian Approach,JULES VAN BINSBERGEN,16 April 2025,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13452,"ABSTRACTUsing international data, we quantify the magnitude of survivorship bias in U.S. equity market performance, finding that it explains about one-third of the equity risk premium in the past century. We model the subjective crash belief of an investor who infers the crash risk in the United States by cross-learning from other countries. The U.S. crash probability shows a persistent and widening divergence from the implied global average. We attribute the upward bias in the measured equity premium to crashes that did not occur in-sample and to shocks to valuations resulting from learning about the probability."
The Term Structure of Interest Rates in a Heterogeneous Monetary Union,JAMES COSTAIN,28 May 2025,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13463,"ABSTRACTWe build an arbitrage-based model of the yield curves in a heterogeneous monetary union with sovereign default risk, which accounts for the asymmetric shifts in euro-area yields during the Covid-19 pandemic. We derive an affine term structure solution, and decompose yields into expectations, term premium, expected default loss, and credit risk premium components. In an extension, we endogenize the peripheral default probability, showing that it decreases with central bank bond holdings. Calibrating the model to Germany and Italy, we show that both the level and the shifts in the sovereign spread are mainly attributable to the credit risk premium."
How Credit Cycles across a Financial Crisis,ARVIND KRISHNAMURTHY,04 March 2025,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13431,"ABSTRACTWe analyze the behavior of credit and output in financial crises using data on credit spreads and credit growth. Crises are marked by a sharp rise in credit spreads, signaling sudden shifts in expectations. The severity of a crisis can be predicted by the extent of credit losses (spread increases) and financial sector fragility (precrisis credit growth). This interaction is a key feature of crises. Postcrisis recessions are typically severe and prolonged. Notably, precrisis spreads tend to drop to low levels while credit growth accelerates, indicating that credit supply expansions often precede crises. The 2008 crisis aligns with these patterns."
"Banks, Low Interest Rates, and Monetary Policy Transmission",OLIVIER WANG,09 March 2025,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13436,"ABSTRACTI study how the secular decline in interest rates affects banks' intermediation spreads and credit supply. Following a permanent decrease in rates, bank lending may rise initially but contracts in the long run. As lower rates compress deposit spreads even well above the zero lower bound, banks' retained earnings, equity, and lending fall until loan spreads have risen enough to offset the reduction in deposit spreads. A higher inflation target can support bank lending at the cost of higher liquidity premia. I find support for the model's predictions in U.S. aggregate and bank-level data."
Collusion in Brokered Markets,JOHN WILLIAM HATFIELD,18 March 2025,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13432,"ABSTRACTHigh commissions in the U.S. residential real estate agency market pose a puzzle for economic theory because brokerage is not a concentrated industry. We model brokered markets as a game in which agents post prices for customers and then choose which other agents to work with. We show that there exists an equilibrium in which each agent conditions working with other agents on those agents' posted prices. Prices can therefore be meaningfully higher than the competitive level (for a fixed discount factor), regardless of the number of agents. Thus, brokered markets can remain uncompetitive even with low concentration and easy entry."
How Much Does Racial Bias Affect Mortgage Lending? Evidence from Human and Algorithmic Credit Decisions,NEIL BHUTTA,09 April 2025,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13444,"ABSTRACTWe assess racial discrimination in mortgage approvals using confidential data on mortgage applications. Minority applicants tend to have lower credit scores and higher leverage, and are less likely to receive algorithmic approval from race-blind automated underwriting systems (AUS). Observable applicant-risk factors explain most of the racial disparities in lender denials. Further, exploiting the AUS data, we show there are risk factors we do not observe, and these factors at least partially explain the residual 1 to 2 percentage point denial gaps. We conclude that differential treatment plays a more limited role in generating denial disparities than previous research suggests."
Social Security and Trends in Wealth Inequality,SYLVAIN CATHERINE,07 April 2025,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13440,ABSTRACTRecent influential work finds large increases in inequality in the United States based on measures of wealth concentration that notably exclude the value of social insurance programs. This paper shows that top wealth shares have not changed much over the last three decades when Social Security is properly accounted for. This is because Social Security wealth increased substantially from $7.2 trillion in 1989 to $40.6 trillion in 2019 and now represents nearly 50% of the wealth of the bottom 90% of the wealth distribution. This finding is robust to potential changes to taxes and benefits in response to system financing concerns.
"Excess Capacity, Marginal q, and Corporate Investment",GUSTAVO GRULLON,11 March 2025,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13439,"ABSTRACTTheory posits that when managers anticipate excess capacity, averageqbecomes a biased estimator of marginalqas the potential for underutilizing new capital reduces the marginal benefit of investing. After correcting for this source of measurement error, the explanatory power of Tobin'sqsubstantially improves in time-series and cross-sectional regressions as well as in out-of-sample tests. These findings, together with a secular erosion in capacity utilization, help explain why corporate investment rates have been declining for decades despite averageqincreasing significantly. Our analysis indicates that economic rigidities have contributed to the persistent erosion in capacity utilization."
In Too Deep: The Effect of Sunk Costs on Corporate Investment,MARIUS GUENZEL,04 March 2025,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13430,"ABSTRACTSunk costs are unrecoverable costs that should not affect decision making. I provide evidence that firms systematically fail to ignore sunk costs and that this leads to significant investment distortions. In fixed-exchange-ratio stock mergers, aggregate market fluctuations after parties enter into a binding merger agreement induce plausibly exogenous variation in the final acquisition cost. These quasi-random cost shocks strongly predict firms' commitment to an acquired business following deal completion, with an interquartile cost increase reducing subsequent divestiture rates by 8% to 9%. Consistent with an intrapersonal sunk cost channel, distortions are concentrated in firm-years in which the acquiring CEO is still in office."
Intrahousehold Disagreement about Macroeconomic Expectations,DA KE,09 March 2025,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13437,"ABSTRACTThis paper highlights the simple fact that households typically consist of multiple members who may hold divergent views, a fact that existing approaches to measuring and modeling household macroeconomic expectations largely abstract from. Using unique data on the macroeconomic expectations of both spouses, I document substantial intrahousehold disagreement about inflation, economic recessions, and stock market returns. I further show that household asset allocation decisions are shaped by disagreement between spouses about future stock returns, and a preregistered randomized survey experiment confirms the causal impact of such disagreement on portfolio choice."
"In the Red: Overdrafts, Payday Lending, and the Underbanked",MARCO DI MAGGIO,31 March 2025,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13447,"ABSTRACTThe reordering of transactions from “high-to-low” is a controversial bank practice thought to maximize fees paid by low-income customers on overdrawn accounts. We exploit a series of class-action lawsuits that mandated that some banks cease the practice. Using alternative credit bureau data, we find that after banks cease high-to-low reordering, low-income individuals reduce payday borrowing, increase consumption, realize long-term improvements in financial health, and gain access to lower-cost loans in the traditional financial system. These findings suggest that aggressive bank practices can create demand for alternative financial services and highlight an important link between the traditional and alternative financial systems."
Conflicting Priorities: A Theory of Covenants and Collateral,JASON RODERICK DONALDSON,09 April 2025,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13445,"ABSTRACTWe develop a theory of secured debt, unsecured debt, and debt with anti-dilution covenants. We assume that, as in practice, covenants convey the right to accelerate if violated, but the new secured debt retains its priority even if issued in violation of covenants. We find that such covenants are nonetheless useful: They provide state-contingent financing flexibility, balancing over- and underinvestment incentives. The optimal debt structure is multilayered, combining secured and unsecured debt with and without covenants. Our results are consistent with observations about debt structure, covenant violations, and waivers. They speak to a policy debate about debt priority."
Auctions versus Negotiations: The Role of the Payment Structure,FLORIAN HOFFMANN,07 April 2025,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13446,"ABSTRACTWe investigate a seller's strategic choice between optimally structured negotiations with fewer bidders and an auction with more competing bidders when payments can have a contingent component, as is common in mergers and acquisitions (M&A), patent licensing, and employee compensation. The key factor favoring negotiations is that it allows the seller to set her preferred payment structure—that is, the revenue-maximizing mix of cash and contingent pay; reserve prices are of secondary importance. Negotiations are more likely to dominate if synergies increase in bidders' productivity types (as with acquirer-target complementarities in M&A). Higher dispersion and magnitude of bidders' private valuations also favor negotiations."
Raising Capital from Investor Syndicates with Strategic Communication,DAN LUO,10 April 2025,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13453,"ABSTRACTAn entrepreneur makes offers to multiple investors to fund a project that requires a minimum investment. Concerned about other investors' decisions, each investor strategically communicates information about the project to others. When investors have conflicts of interest, those with contractually stronger incentives to invest attempt to persuade others to invest. Depending on the project's ex ante quality, the entrepreneur may promise investors different returns to create conflicts of interest and induce persuasion, or may promise investors an identical return to align their interests and induce truthful communication. The paper illustrates a new motivation for syndication and hierarchy within syndicates."
The Disappearing Index Effect,ROBIN GREENWOOD,20 December 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13410,"ABSTRACTThe abnormal return associated with a stock being added to the S&P 500 has fallen from an average of 7.4% in the 1990s to less than 1% over the past decade. This has occurred despite a significant increase in the share of stock market assets linked to the index. A similar pattern has occurred for index deletions, with large negative abnormal returns during the 1990s but an average return of only 0.1% between 2010 and 2020. We investigate the drivers of this phenomenon and discuss implications for market efficiency. We document a similar decline in the index effect among other families of indices."
Sustainability or Greenwashing: Evidence from the Asset Market for Industrial Pollution,RAN DUCHIN,30 December 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13412,"ABSTRACTWe study the asset market for pollutive plants. Firms divest pollutive plants in response to environmental pressures. Buyers are firms facing weaker environmental pressures that have supply chain relationships or joint ventures with the sellers. While pollution levels do not decline following divestitures, sellers highlight their sustainable policies in subsequent conference calls, earn higher returns as they sell more pollutive plants, and benefit from higher Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) ratings and lower compliance costs. Overall, the asset market allows firms to redraw their boundaries in a manner perceived as environmentally friendly without real consequences for pollution but with substantial gains from trade."
The Allocation of Socially Responsible Capital,DANIEL GREEN,22 January 2025,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13425,"ABSTRACTPortfolio allocation decisions increasingly incorporate social values. We develop a tractable framework to study how competition between investors to own socially valuable assets affects social welfare. Relative to the most common social-investing strategies, we identify alternative strategies that result in higher impact and higher financial returns. We identify strategies for investors to have impact when impact is difficult to measure. From the firm's perspective, increasing profitability can have greater impact than directly increasing social value. We present new empirical evidence on the social preferences of investors that demonstrates the practical relevance of our theory."
Pricing Poseidon: Extreme Weather Uncertainty and Firm Return Dynamics,MATHIAS S. KRUTTLI,13 January 2025,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13416,"ABSTRACTWe empirically analyze firm-level uncertainty generated from extreme weather events, guided by a theoretical framework. Stock options of firms with establishments in a hurricane's (forecast) landfall region exhibit large implied volatility increases, reflecting significant uncertainty (before) after impact. Volatility risk premium dynamics reveal that investors underestimate such uncertainty. This underreaction diminishes for hurricanes after Sandy, a salient event that struck the U.S. financial center. Despite constituting idiosyncratic shocks, hurricanes affect hit firms' expected stock returns. Textual analysis of calls between firm management, analysts, and investors reveals that discussions about hurricane impacts remain elevated throughout the long-lasting high-uncertainty period after landfall."
Designing Stress Scenarios,CECILIA PARLATORE,24 January 2025,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13422,"ABSTRACTWe study the optimal design of stress scenarios. A principal manages the unknown risk exposures of agents by asking them to report losses under hypothetical scenarios before taking remedial actions. We apply a Kalman filter to solve the learning problem, and we relate the optimal design to the risk environment, the principal's preferences, and available interventions. In a banking context, optimal capital requirements cover losses under an adverse scenario, while targeted interventions depend on covariances among residual exposures and systematic risks. Our calibration reveals that information is particularly valuable for targeted interventions as opposed to broad capital requirements."
Crisis Interventions in Corporate Insolvency,SAMUEL ANTILL,30 January 2025,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13421,"ABSTRACTWe model the optimal resolution of insolvent firms in general equilibrium. Collateral-constrained banks lend to (i) solvent firms to finance investments and (ii) distressed firms to avoid liquidation. Liquidations create negative fire-sale externalities. Liquidations also relieve bank balance–sheet congestion, enabling new firm loans that generate positive collateral externalities by lowering bank borrowing rates. Socially optimal interventions encourage liquidation when firms have high operating losses, high leverage, or low productivity. Surprisingly, larger fire sales promote interventions encouraging more liquidations. We study synergies between insolvency interventions and macroprudential regulation, bailouts, deferred loss recognition, and debt subordination. Our model elucidates historical crisis interventions."
Repo over the Financial Crisis,ADAM COPELAND,10 February 2025,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13406,"ABSTRACTThis paper uses new data to provide a comprehensive view of repo activity during the 2007 global financial crisis. We show that activity declined much more in the bilateral segment of the market than in the tri-party segment. Surprisingly, a large share of the decline in activity is driven by repos backed by Treasury securities. Further, a disproportionate share of the decline in repo activity is connected to securities dealer's market-making activity. In particular, the evidence suggests that at least part of the decline is not driven by clients pulling away from securities dealers because of counterparty credit concerns."
Worker Runs,FLORIAN HOFFMANN,30 January 2025,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13424,"ABSTRACTThe voluntary departure of hard-to-replace skilled workers worsens firm prospects, which can lead to additional departures. We develop a model in which firms design compensation to limit the risk of such “worker runs.” To achieve cost-efficient retention, firms combine fixed wages with dilutable compensation—such as vesting equity or bonus pools—which pays remaining workers more when others leave but gets diluted otherwise. Compensating (identical) workers with differently structured compensation, that is, with a different mix of output-dependent and output-independent pay, can further mitigate the risk of worker runs by ensuring a critical retention level in a cost-efficient way."
Feedback Effects and Systematic Risk Exposures,SNEHAL BANERJEE,30 January 2025,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13427,"ABSTRACTWe model the “feedback effect” of a firm's stock price on investment in projects exposed to a systematic risk factor, like climate risk. The stock price reflects information about both the project's cash flows and its discount rate. A cash-flow-maximizing manager treats discount rate fluctuations as “noise,” but a price-maximizing manager interprets such variation as information about the project's net present value. This difference qualitatively changes how investment behavior varies with the project's risk exposure. Moreover, traditional objectives (e.g., cash flow or price maximization) need not maximize welfare because they do not correctly account for hedging and risk-sharing benefits of investment."
Simplicity and Risk,INDIRA PURI,30 December 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13417,"ABSTRACTI introduce and test for preference for simplicity in choice under risk. I characterize the theory axiomatically, and derive its properties and unique predictions relative to canonical models. By designing and running theoretically motivated experiments, I document that people value simplicity in ways not fully captured by existing models that study risk premia in financial markets. Participants' risk premia increase as complexity increases, holding moments fixed; their dominance violations increase in complexity; their behavior is predicted by simplicity's characterizing axiom; and their complexity aversion is heterogeneous in cognitive ability. None of expected utility theory, cumulative prospect theory, prospect theory, rational inattention, sparsity, salience, or probability weighting that differs by number of outcomes fully capture the experimental findings. I generalize the underlying theory to additionally capture broader measures of complexity, including obfuscation, computation, and language effects."
Regulatory Fragmentation,JOSEPH KALMENOVITZ,30 January 2025,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13423,"ABSTRACTRegulatory fragmentation occurs when multiple federal agencies oversee a single issue. Using the full text of the Federal Register, the government's official daily publication, we provide the first systematic evidence on the extent and costs of regulatory fragmentation. Fragmentation increases the firm's costs while lowering its productivity, profitability, and growth. Moreover, it deters entry into an industry and increases the propensity of small firms to exit. These effects arise from redundancy and, more prominently, from inconsistencies between government agencies. Our results uncover a new source of regulatory burden, and we show that agency costs among regulators contribute to this burden."
Wealth and Insurance Choices: Evidence from U.S. Households,MICHAEL J. GROPPER,30 January 2025,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13426,"ABSTRACTUsing administrative data for 63,000 individuals across 2,500,000 person-month observations, we find that wealthier individuals have better life insurance coverage, controlling for the value of the asset insured, namely, the consumption needs of dependents. This positive wealth-insurance correlation, which is surprising given the prevailing view that wealth substitutes for insurance, persists after allowing for wealth-related differences in risk or bequest preferences, pricing, background risk, education, employment, or liquidity constraints. Our findings call for further investigation of this wealth-coverage correlation but support theories emphasizing the consumption-smoothing role of insurance across not only states of the world, but also time."
"Working More to Pay the Mortgage: Household Debt, Interest Rates, and Family Labor Supply",Michał Zator,16 December 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13413,"ABSTRACTI show that households work and earn more (less) when their floating-rate mortgage payments quasi-exogenously increase (decrease). The response is sizable and asymmetric: on average, households adjust their income by 35% of the change in their mortgage payment, but the response is significantly stronger following an increase in payments. While men in dual-earner, childless households respond the most on average, the asymmetry is most pronounced for women and young workers, who respond particularly strongly to payment increases. The asymmetry of the labor supply elasticity may help explain the wide range of elasticities found in previous research."
The Impact of Minority Representation at Mortgage Lenders,W. SCOTT FRAME,11 February 2025,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13428,"ABSTRACTWe study links between the labor market for loan officers and access to mortgage credit. Using novel data matching mortgage applications to loan officers, we find that minorities are underrepresented among loan officers. Minority borrowers are less likely to complete mortgage applications, have completed applications approved, and to ultimately take up a loan. These disparities are reduced when minority borrowers work with minority loan officers. These pairings also lead to lower default rates, suggesting minority loan officers have an informational advantage with minority borrowers. Our results suggest minority underrepresentation among loan officers reduces minority borrowers’ access to credit."
Uncovering the Hidden Effort Problem,AZI BEN-REPHAEL,17 February 2025,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13429,"ABSTRACTWe analyze minute-by-minute Bloomberg online status and study how the effort provision of executives in public corporations affects firm value. While executives spend most of their time doing other activities, patterns of Bloomberg usage allow us to characterize their work habits as measures of effort provision. We document a positive effect of effort on unexpected earnings and cumulative abnormal returns following earnings announcements, and a reduction in credit default swap spreads. This is robust to using exogenous weather patterns as an instrument. Long-short, calendar-time effort portfolios earn significant average daily returns. Finally, we revisit important agency issues from the literature."
Report of the Editor of The Journal of Finance for the Year 2024,ANTOINETTE SCHOAR,18 March 2025,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13435,
"Bank Funding Risk, Reference Rates, and Credit Supply",HARRY COOPERMAN,20 December 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13411,"ABSTRACTCorporate credit lines are drawn more heavily when funding markets are stressed. This elevates expected bank funding costs. We show that credit supply is dampened by the associated debt-overhang cost to bank shareholders. Until 2022, this impact was reduced by linking the interest paid on lines to a credit-sensitive reference rate like the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR). We show that transition to risk-free reference rates may exacerbate this friction. The adverse impact on credit supply is offset if drawdowns are expected to be deposited at the same bank, which happened at some of the largest banks during the global financial crisis and COVID recession."
Intermediary Leverage Shocks and Funding Conditions,JEAN-SÉBASTIEN FONTAINE,23 December 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13407,"ABSTRACTThe aggregate leverage of broker-dealers responds to demand and supply disturbances that have opposite effects on financial markets. Specifically, leverage supply shocks that relax broker-dealers' funding constraints increase leverage, liquidity, and returns and carry a positive price of risk, while leverage demand shocks also increase leverage but reduce liquidity and returns and carry a negative price of risk. Disentangling demand- and supply-like shocks resolves existing puzzles around the price of leverage risk and yields consistent evidence across many markets of a central role for intermediation frictions and dealers' aggregate leverage in asset pricing."
The Global Credit Spread Puzzle,JING-ZHI HUANG,20 December 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13409,"ABSTRACTWe examine the ability of structural models to predict credit spreads using global default data and security-level credit spread data in eight developed economies. We find that two representative, pure default-risk models tend to underpredict the average credit spreads on investment-grade (IG) bonds, especially their spreads over government bonds, thereby providing evidence for a “global credit spread puzzle.” However, a model incorporating endogenous liquidity in the secondary debt market helps mitigate the puzzle. Furthermore, the model captures certain determinants of corporate bond market frictions across the eight economies and substantially improves the cross-sectional fit of individual IG credit spreads."
Private Equity and Financial Stability: Evidence from Failed-Bank Resolution in the Crisis,EMILY JOHNSTON-ROSS,27 November 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13399,"ABSTRACTThis paper investigates the role of private equity (PE) in failed-bank resolutions after the 2008 financial crisis, using proprietary Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation failed-bank acquisition data. PE investors made substantial investments in underperforming and riskier failed banks, particularly in geographies where local banks were also distressed, filling the gap created by a weak, undercapitalized banking sector. Using a quasi-random empirical design based on detailed bidding information, we show that PE-acquired banks performed better ex post, with positive real effects for the local economy. Overall, PE investors played a positive role in stabilizing the financial system through their involvement in failed-bank resolution."
Equilibrium Data Mining and Data Abundance,JÉRÔME DUGAST,27 October 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13397,"ABSTRACTWe study theoretically how the proliferation of new data (“data abundance”) affects the allocation of capital between quantitative and nonquantitative asset managers (“data miners” and “experts”), their performance, and price informativeness. Data miners search for predictors of asset payoffs and select those with a sufficiently high precision. Data abundance raises the precision of the best predictors, but it can induce data miners to search less intensively for high-precision signals. In this case, their performance becomes more dispersed and they receive less capital. Nevertheless, data abundance always raises price informativeness and can therefore reduce asset managers' average performance."
Test Assets and Weak Factors,STEFANO GIGLIO,18 December 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13415,"ABSTRACTWe show that two important issues in empirical asset pricing—the presence of weak factors and the selection of test assets—are deeply connected. Since weak factors are those to which test assets have limited exposure, an appropriate selection of test assets can improve the strength of factors. Building on this insight, we introduce supervised principal component analysis (SPCA), a methodology that iterates supervised selection, principal-component estimation, and factor projection. It enables risk premia estimation and factor model diagnosis even when weak factors are present and not all factors are observed. We establish SPCA's asymptotic properties and showcase its empirical applications."
Decentralized Exchange: The Uniswap Automated Market Maker,ALFRED LEHAR,20 December 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13405,"ABSTRACTUniswap is a system of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain and is the largest decentralized exchange with a liquidity balance worth up to 4 billion USD and daily trading volume of up to 7 billion USD. It is a new model of liquidity provision, so-called automated market making. For this new market form, we characterize equilibrium in the liquidity pools. We collect all 95.8 million Uniswap interactions and compare this automated market maker (AMM) to a centralized limit order book. We document absence of long-lived arbitrage opportunities, and show conditions under which the AMM dominates a limit order market."
Does Floor Trading Matter?,JONATHAN BROGAARD,27 October 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13401,"ABSTRACTAlthough algorithmic trading now dominates financial markets, some exchanges continue to use human floor traders. On March 23, 2020 the NYSE suspended floor trading because of COVID-19. Using a difference-in-differences analysis around the closure of the floor, we find that floor traders are important contributors to market quality. The suspension of floor trading leads to higher spreads and larger pricing errors for treated stocks relative to control stocks. To explore the mechanism, we exploit two partial floor reopenings that have different characteristics. Our finding suggests that in-person human interaction facilitates the transfer of valuable information that algorithms lack."
"Scope, Scale, and Concentration: The 21st-Century Firm",GERARD HOBERG,04 November 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13400,"ABSTRACTWe provide evidence using firm 10-Ks that over the past 30 years, U.S. firms have expanded their scope of operations. Increases in scope were achieved largely without increasing traditional operating segments. Scope expansion significantly increases valuation and is realized primarily through acquisitions and investment in R&D, but not through capital expenditures. Traditional concentration ratios do not capture this expansion of scope. Our findings point to a new type of firm that increases scope through related expansion, which is highly valued by the market."
Sending Out an SMS: Automatic Enrollment Experiments for Overdraft Alerts,MICHAEL D. GRUBB,26 December 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13404,"ABSTRACTAt-scale field experiments at major U.K. banks show that automatic enrollment into “just-in-time” text alerts reduces unarranged overdraft and unpaid item charges 17% to 19% and arranged overdraft charges 4% to 8%, implying annual market-wide savings of £170 million to £240 million. Incremental benefits from “early-warning” alerts are statistically insignificant, although economically significant effects are not ruled out. Prior to the experiments, over half of overdrafts could have been avoided by using lower-cost liquidity available in savings and credit card accounts. Alerts help consumers achieve less than half of these potential savings."
Personal Communication in an Automated World: Evidence from Loan Repayments,CHRISTINE LAUDENBACH,28 November 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13388,"ABSTRACTWe examine the effect of personal, two-way communication on the payment behavior of delinquent borrowers. Borrowers who speak with a randomly assigned bank agent are significantly more likely to successfully resolve the delinquency relative to borrowers who do not speak with a bank agent. Call characteristics related to the human touch of the call, such as the likeability of the agent's voice, significantly affect payment behavior. Borrowers who speak with a bank agent are also significantly less likely to become delinquent again. Our findings highlight the value of a human element in interactions between financial institutions and their customers."
Dynamic Competition in Negotiated Price Markets,JASON ALLEN,13 December 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13408,"ABSTRACTUsing contract-level data for the Canadian mortgage market, this paper provides evidence of an “invest-and-harvest” pricing pattern. We build a dynamic model of price negotiation with search and switching frictions to capture key market features. We estimate the model and use it to investigate the effects of market frictions and the resulting dynamic competition on borrowers' and banks' payoffs. We show that dynamic pricing and the presence of search and switching costs have important implications for public policies."
Carbon Returns across the Globe,SHAOJUN ZHANG,21 October 2024,The Journal of Finance,,/doi/10.1111/jofi.13402,"ABSTRACTThe pricing of carbon transition risk is central to the debate on climate-aware investments. Emissions are tightly linked to sales and are available to investors only with significant lags. The positive carbon return, or brown-minus-green return differential, documented in previous studies arises from forward-looking firm performance information contained in emissions rather than a risk premium in ex ante expected returns. After accounting for the data release lag, carbon returns turn negative in the United States and insignificant globally. Developed markets experience lower carbon returns due to intense climate concern shocks, while countries with stringent climate policies exhibit higher carbon returns."

"“I’m not hoarding, I’m just stocking up before the hoarders get here.”",John D. Sterman,26 July 2015,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2015.07.002,"AbstractWhen suppliers are unable to fill orders, delivery delays increase and customers receive less than they desire. Customers often respond by seeking larger safety stocks (hoarding) and by ordering more than they need to meet demand (phantom ordering). Such actions cause still longer delivery times, creating positive feedbacks that intensify scarcity and destabilize supply chains. Hoarding and phantom ordering can be rational when customers compete for limited supply in the presence of uncertainty or capacity constraints. But they may also be behavioral and emotional responses to scarcity. To address this question we extendCroson et al.’s (2014)experimental study with the Beer Distribution Game. Hoarding and phantom ordering are never rational in the experiment because there is no horizontal competition, randomness, or capacity constraint; further, customer demand is constant and participants have common knowledge of that fact. Nevertheless 22% of participants place orders more than 25 times greater than the known, constant demand. We generalize the ordering heuristic used in prior research to include the possibility of endogenous hoarding and phantom ordering. Estimation results strongly support the hypothesis, with hoarding and phantom ordering particularly strong for the outliers who placed extremely large orders. We discuss psychiatric and neuroanatomical evidence showing that environmental stressors can trigger the impulse to hoard, overwhelming rational decision-making. We speculate that stressors such as large orders, backlogs or late deliveries trigger hoarding and phantom ordering for some participants even though these behaviors are irrational. We discuss implications for supply chain design and behavioral operations research."
How analytic reasoning style and global thinking relate to understanding stocks and flows,Justin M. Weinhardt,26 July 2015,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2015.07.003,"AbstractUnderstanding stock-flow relationships is fundamental to the management of operational systems. In their most basic form, stock-flow systems consist of resources that accumulate and flows that change their level. Managing stock-flow systems is an indispensable part of operations management, including supply chain, inventory, and capacity planning. Previous studies have shown that most people, even experts and well-educated individuals, make persistent errors when inferring the behavior of accumulation (i.e., stock) over time. However, little is known about what individual characteristics make a decision maker better or worse at understanding stock-flows. In this paper, we report the results of investigating the relationship between analytical-intuitive thinking and global-local processing on performance in a simple stock-flow problem.We find that individuals with an analytical thinking style, rather than an intuitive one, perform significantly better on a stock-flow problem; whereas individuals with a global, rather than a local, thinking style do not necessarily perform better. However, even individuals who exhibit analytical thinking have a poor understanding of stock-flow problems. Analytical thinking may be related to understanding stock and flows, but more work is needed to better understand what cognitive abilities are required to solve these problems.HighlightsThe paper examines the understanding of stock-flow systems, which consist of resources that accumulate and flows that change their level over time.Managing stock-flow systems is an indispensable part of operations management, including supply chain management, inventory management, and capacity planning.Research has found that individuals make persistent errors in inferring the behavior of accumulation (i.e., stock) over time.We investigated the relationship of individual’s analytical-intuitive thinking and global-local processing and performance in a simple stock-flow problem.Results indicate that analytical thinking is positively related to performance, but global thinking is not."
Cost-sharing in directed networks: Experimental study of equilibrium choice and system dynamics,Caiyun Liu,26 July 2015,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2015.07.004,"AbstractThis study reports the results of an experiment on directed networks with positive externalities induced by cost-sharing. Subjects participated in a network game in which they had to choose between private and public transportations. If a player chose public transportation, then she shared the travel cost equally with other players making the same choice, whereas if she chose private transportation, then her travel cost was fixed. Travel costs on the private route were manipulated across the two experimental conditions. In one condition, these costs were homogeneous among players; in the other condition, they were heterogeneous among players and only privately known. We found that half (none) of the player groups in the homogeneous (heterogeneous) condition converged toward the efficient equilibrium. Examination of the system dynamics shows that convergence toward efficiency was facilitated by: (1) the existence of an intermediate equilibrium choice; and (2) strategic teaching by which a farsighted player chooses strategies with poor short-term payoff in order to shift group decisions to the efficient equilibrium and thereby increase her own long-term benefit."
Inter-phase feedbacks in construction projects,Kiavash Parvan,29 July 2015,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2015.07.005,"AbstractUnderstanding diverse performance trajectories of projects is of interest to operations researchers and practitioners. Interactions between multiple phases of a project are commonly assumed to be important in project dynamics, yet the strength of these feedback mechanisms has not been rigorously evaluated. In this study we use data from 15 construction projects to estimate the feedbacks between design and construction phases. The estimated factors reveal that undiscovered design rework diminishes construction quality and production rate significantly and construction completion speeds up the detection of undiscovered design rework. Together, these feedbacks can explain as much as 20% of variability in overall project costs. Comparison of model predictions with a separate set of 15 projects shows good predictive power for cost and schedule outcomes and their uncertainty. The estimation and prediction framework offers a template for using data from multiple cases to estimate both case-specific and industry-wide parameters of project models, and for leveraging those estimates for project planning."
Inventory record inaccuracy: Causes and labor effects,Howard Hao-Chun Chuang,31 July 2015,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2015.07.006,"AbstractInventory record inaccuracy (IRI) is a pervasive problem in retailing and causes non-trivial profit loss. In response to retailers’ interest in identifying antecedents and consequences of IRI, we present a study that comprises multiple modeling initiatives. We first develop a dynamic simulation model to compare and contrast impacts of different operational errors in a continuous (Q,R) inventory system through a full-factorial experimental design. While backroom and shelf shrinkage are found to be predominant drivers of IRI, the other three errors related to recording and shelving have negligible impacts on IRI. Next, we empirically assess the relationships between labor availability and IRI using longitudinal data from five stores in a global retail chain. After deriving a robust measure of IRI through Bayesian computation and estimating panel data models, we find strong evidence that full-time labor reduces IRI whereas part-time labor fails to alleviate it. Further, we articulate the reinforcing relationships between labor and IRI by formally assessing the gain of the feedback loop based on our empirical findings and analyzing immediate, intermediate, and long-term impacts of IRI on labor availability. The feedback modeling effort not only integrates findings from simulation and econometric analysis but also structurally explores the impacts of current practices. We conclude by discussing implications of our findings for practitioners and researchers."
The problem with workarounds is that they work: The persistence of resource shortages,Bradley Morrison,29 July 2015,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2015.07.008,"AbstractIndustrious, well-intentioned workers often improvisein situsolutions to workplace challenges foist on them by shortcomings of the systems in which they work. For example, resource shortages trigger workplace pressures that may stimulate front line coping mechanisms, often called workarounds. There has been surprisingly little attention to questions about why these resource shortages occur and even more insidiously why they persist despite the apparently clear adverse consequences. Motivated by field work at a manufacturing firm adopting lean manufacturing, this paper develops a system dynamics model to understand chronic resource shortages and calls attention to the nature of workarounds as both a solution to a front line problem and a mask of the underlying system weakness. The model illuminates how the actions of various groups (e.g., managers, production workers, and other shop floor workers) interact with each other and with the physical characteristics of the workplace to sustain problematic resource shortages."
Collaboration in Multi-Partner R&D Projects: The Impact of Partnering Scale and Scope,Anant Mishra,28 September 2014,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2014.09.008,"AbstractHow can firms design collaboration structures for effective performance in R&D projects that involve multiple partners? To address this question, we examine the theoretical underpinnings of collaboration structures in multi-partner R&D projects—i.e., the scale and the scope of partnering efforts. Partnering scale captures the extent of resource interdependencies between a firm and its partners; partnering scope captures both the breadth and depth of the interdependencies between a firm and its partners. Using primary data from 147 multi-partner R&D projects, we develop and test hypotheses that examine the impact of partnering scale and scope decisions on partnering performance. Results indicate that partnering scale has a curvilinear relationship with partnering performance. That is, intermediate levels of partnering scale are associated with higher partnering performance, compared to low or high levels of partnering scale. However, we also find that the nature of this relationship is moderated by the sub-dimensions of partnering scope. Specifically, increase in partnering breadth appears to magnify the negative effect of partnering scale on performance. In contrast, increase in partnering depth appears to overcome this negative effect, allowing firms to operate at higher levels of partnering scale. Taken together, these results highlight the importance of adopting a comprehensive approach to designing collaboration structures for multi-partner R&D projects."
Revisiting the interplay between contractual and relational governance: A qualitative and meta-analytic investigation,Zhi Cao,02 October 2014,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2014.09.009,"AbstractAlthough extant literature has shown that formal contracts and relational governance play a key role in interorganizational relationships, the nature of their interplay still remains equivocal. To better understand the relationships between contractual and relational governance, we conducted a qualitative review and meta-analysis of the existing literature. Meta-analytic results from 33,051 interorganizational relationships across 149 empirical studies have indicated that contractual governance is positively related to both sides of relational governance—trust and relational norms. Our results have also indicated that contracts, trust, and relational norms jointly improve satisfaction and relationship performance and jointly reduce opportunism. These findings provide strong evidence for the complementarity arguments of the contractual–relational governance relationships and their joint impacts on performance. We also found that the mutual relationships between contractual and relational governance are moderated by the institutional environments, the interorganizational relationship type and length, and the construct measurement of contracts. Overall, this study provides new insights onwhencontractual and relational governance complement or substitute each other. We discuss the implications of our study for theory and practice and propose a research agenda for future research on governance in interorganizational relationships."
Supply network disruption and resilience: A network structural perspective,Yusoon Kim,27 October 2014,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2014.10.006,"AbstractIncreasingly, scholars recognize the importance of understandingsupply network disruptions. However, the literature still lacks a clear conceptualization of a network-level understanding of supply disruptions. Not having a network level understanding of supply disruptions prevents firms from fully mitigating the negative effects of a supply disruption. Graph theory helps to conceptualize a supply network and differentiate between disruptions at the node/arc level vs. network level. The structure of a supply network consists of a collection of nodes (facilities) and the connecting arcs (transportation). From this perspective, small events that disrupt a node or arc in the network can have major consequences for the network. A failure in a node or arc can potentially stop the flow of material across network. This study conceptualizes supply network disruption and resilience by examining the structural relationships among entities in the network. We compare four fundamental supply network structures to help understand supply network disruption and resilience. The analysis shows that node/arc-level disruptions do not necessarily lead to network-level disruptions, and demonstrates the importance of differentiating a node/arc disruption vs. a network disruption. The results also indicate that network structure significantly determines the likelihood of disruption. In general, different structural relationships among network entities have different levels of resilience. More specifically, resilience improves when the structural relationships in a network follow thepower-law. This paper not only offers a new perspective of supply network disruption, but also suggests a useful analytical approach to assessing supply network structures for resilience."
Sourcing for the base of the pyramid: Constructing supply chains to address voids in subsistence markets,Anne Parmigiani,31 October 2014,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2014.10.007,"AbstractSubstantial work has described downstream distribution systems for subsistence markets, but little is known about how upstream supply chains support these efforts. We suggest that a multinational corporation (MNC) entering these markets must resolve the institutional voids in product, labor, and capital markets, as well as address issues of regulatory ambiguities and the lack of contracting mechanisms that exist at the raw material, manufacturing, distribution, and marketing stages of the supply chain. We analyze the nature of these voids and their challenges, map them onto the value chain, discuss their interconnections, and suggest that they do not impact all firms equally. We provide examples from the food, beverage, and textile industries of how four firms have addressed institutional voids in constructing their supply chains. We conclude by providing implications, both across the value chain and regarding the trade-offs of partnering with non-profit agencies. Our analysis highlights the importance of going beyond the broad impact of the institutional environment to understanding its more nuanced and multi-faceted effect on supply chains."
Performance outcomes of supply chain agility: When should you be agile?,David M. Gligor,31 October 2014,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2014.10.008,"AbstractTraditionally, researchers have claimed agility as an attribute closely tied to the effectiveness of strategic supply chain management. Because of its association with customer effectiveness, some researchers have considered agility to be fundamentally different from lean, which has been linked to cost efficiency (Goldsby et al., 2006). Therefore, the relationship between agility and cost efficiency is not clear due to limited empirical scrutiny from researchers. Since elimination of waste is the cornerstone of lean, unraveling the relationship between agility and efficiency can also offer a better perspective on relationship between the fundamental paradigms of agility and lean. The manuscript makes a key contribution to the agility literature by examining the association between supply chain agility (FSCA), cost efficiency and customer effectiveness across various environmental situations. We use archival data to examine the moderating effects of environmental munificence, dynamism, and complexity. It has been argued that firms should embrace agile strategies when operating in highly uncertain environments, and embrace lean strategies when operating in more stable environments (Lee, 2002; Sebastiao and Golicic, 2008). We empirically question this premise to determine whether supply chain agility can also lead to superior performance for firms operating in stable environments. The study results also provide a better understanding of how FSCA contributes to firm financial performance. We evaluate the impact of FSCA on the firm's Return on Assets using archival data from the Compustat database. Thus, we provide evidence to managers that deploying resource to enhance FSCA can positively impact the firm's bottom line."
The relationship between team autonomy and new product development performance under different levels of technological turbulence⋆,Jiyao Chen,12 October 2014,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2014.10.001,"AbstractOperations management researchers have frequently suggested that autonomy can motivate teams to actively and flexibly adapt to fast-changing environments, fostering innovation and creative problem solving. However, empirical studies have not consistently supported the benefits of team autonomy. We articulate the behavioral and mechanistic effects of team autonomy by integrating operations management and behavioral literatures. Further, we view team autonomy as a bipolar factor and argue that both the behavioral and mechanistic effects of team autonomy on operational outcomes are non-linear. Drawing on information processing theory, we propose that the benefits of team autonomy depend on the degree of technological turbulence. A study of 212 new product development projects supports these propositions. Specifically, the relationship between team autonomy and operational outcomes is ∩-shaped in technologically turbulent environments and U-shaped in technologically stable environments. Further, operational outcomes mediate the relationships between team autonomy and product success. We discuss the theoretical implications regarding new product development, operations management, the bipolarity of autonomy, and information-processing theory."

The importance of client heterogeneity in predicting make-or-buy decisions,Geoffrey M. Kistruck,15 November 2014,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2014.11.001,"AbstractScholars have begun to merge the transaction cost economics and capabilities perspectives to examine outsourcing decisions. Further integrating these perspectives with intermediation theory, we assert that a firm's decision to use an intermediary when entering a foreign market is largely a function of the intermediary's relative capabilities and relative transaction costs (i.e., relative advantage). We hypothesize that the intermediary's relative advantage is influenced by three significantly intertwined exchange conditions: client heterogeneity, intermediary risk, and firm learning. Using a sample of 929 new foreign market initiatives by a global consulting firm, our results support our theory."
Firm's resilience to supply chain disruptions: Scale development and empirical examination,Saurabh Ambulkar,18 November 2014,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2014.11.002,"AbstractThis paper expands our understanding of factors that contribute to development of firm resilience to supply chain disruptions. In doing so, we operationalize firm resilience to understand how supply chain disruption orientated firms can develop resilience to supply chain disruptions. We find that supply chain disruption orientation alone is not enough for a firm to develop resilience. Supply chain disruption oriented firms require the ability to reconfigure resources or have a risk management resource infrastructure to develop resilience. The way in which supply chain disruption oriented firms develop resilience through resource reconfiguration or risk management infrastructure depends on the context of the disruption as high impact or low impact. In a high impact disruption context, resource reconfiguration fully mediates the relationship between supply chain disruption orientation and firm resilience. In a low impact disruption context, supply chain disruption orientation and risk management infrastructure have a synergistic effect on developing firm resilience."
Operational and strategic information processing: Complementing healthcare IT infrastructure,John W. Gardner,03 December 2014,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2014.11.003,"AbstractHealthcare information technologies (HIT) have been promoted as key enablers of improved patient safety, reduced medical errors, and increased patient satisfaction but have yielded mixed results. Drawing upon information processing theory and quality management concepts, we examine HIT infrastructure simultaneously with two distinct means of processing information: (1) operational use of error data for detecting and reducing hospital errors, and (2) strategic use of objective data for organizational planning. We use time-sequenced data to examine HIT infrastructure (secondary data in 2008), information processing mechanisms (primary survey data from 258 hospitals in 2009), and two measures of hospital performance: (1) care quality, and (2) patient satisfaction (secondary data in 2010). Using hierarchical regression analysis we find that whether and how investments in HIT infrastructure are complemented by information processing mechanisms depends upon the performance measure under consideration and the form of information processing employed. Specifically, operational error processing complements HIT infrastructure in its association with higher care quality but not with patient satisfaction. In comparison, higher levels of strategic information processing complement HIT infrastructure in its association with higher patient satisfaction."
Assessing the contingent effects of collaboration on agility performance in buyer–supplier relationships,Sriram Narayanan,16 December 2014,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2014.11.004,"AbstractSeveral studies in the buyer–supplier relationship literature have addressed the impact of collaboration on agility performance. While some studies have concluded that collaboration leads to beneficial effects, others have questioned the positive effects of collaboration on relationship performance. Drawing on contingency theory and transaction cost economics (TCE), we seek to better understand the linkage among collaboration, trust and agility performance in a buyer–supplier relationship. Further, we study the contingent influence of requirements certainty and supplier asset specificity, two key TCE constructs in buyer–supplier relationships, on the collaboration–agility performance relationship. We show that while trust mediates the impact of collaboration on agility performance, the indirect effect of collaboration on agility performance via trust is significant only beyond a threshold level of collaboration. The theoretical implication of this result is that the performance relationship is non-linear, a result that has not been recognized in current literature. The practical implication is that organizations need to establish a certain level of collaboration before its positive impact can be realized. In addition, we show that the impact of collaboration on agility performance in buyer–supplier sourcing relationships can bepositive,negativeorneutraldepending on the levels of trust, supplier asset specificity and requirements certainty, emphasizing the need to develop contingency theories."

Sustainable evaluation and verification in supply chains: Aligning and leveraging accountability to stakeholders,Jury Gualandris,04 July 2015,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2015.06.002,"AbstractManagers are being challenged by multiple (and diverse) stakeholders, which have variety of expectations and informational needs about their firm’s supply chains. Collectively, these expectations and needs form a multi-faceted view of stakeholder accountability, namely the extent to which a firm justifies behaviors and actions across its extended supply chain to stakeholders. To date, sustainable supply chain management research has largely focused on monitoring as a self-managed set of narrowly defined evaluative activities employed by firms to provide stakeholder accountability. Nevertheless, evidence is emerging that firms have developed a wide variety of monitoring systems in order to align with stakeholders’ expectations and leverage accountability to stakeholders. Drawing from the accounting literature, we synthesize a model that proposes how firms might address accountability for sustainability issues in their supply chain. At its core, the construct of sustainable evaluation and verification (SEV) captures three interrelated dimensions: inclusivity, scope, and disclosure. These dimensions characterize how supply chain processes might identify key measures, collect and process data, and finally, verify materiality, reliability and accuracy of any data and resulting information. As a result, the concept of monitoring is significantly extended, while also considering how different stakeholders can play diverse, active roles as metrics are established, audits are conducted, and information is validated. Also, several antecedents of SEV systems are explored. Finally, the means by which an SEV system can create a competitive advantage are investigated."
Linking business strategy to service failures and financial performance: Empirical evidence from the U.S. domestic airline industry,Mahour Mellat-Parast,26 July 2015,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2015.06.003,"AbstractDeveloping an understanding of the relationship between service quality and profitability is of central importance to operations management scholars. In this study we seek to reconcile inconsistencies between extant theory and empirical findings regarding the relationship between service quality and profitability in the airline industry. More specifically, we draw on theories from strategic management, operations strategy, and economics to explain why the relationship between measures of service quality and profitability will be moderated by an airline's competitive strategy. We test our hypotheses by fitting mixed-effects models to longitudinal data obtained from several governmental databases in the context of the U.S. domestic airline industry. We find that airline strategy moderates the relationship between some service failures and profitability. Specifically, we find that mishandled baggage and customer complaints more negatively affect the profitability of focused than non-focused airlines. We also find the relationship between arrival delays on profitability is universally negative for focused airlines, but displays an inverted U-shaped relationship for non-focused airlines. Our findings provide significant contributions to the existing body of knowledge in service quality and operations strategy. We further outline the implications of these findings for practice and future research."
Execution quality: An analysis of fulfillment errors at a retail distribution center,Nathan Craig,31 July 2015,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2015.07.007,"AbstractPurchase orders specify many aspects of a fulfillment process, including item quantity, delivery time, carton labeling, bar coding, electronic data interchange, retail ticketing, and others. These fulfillment terms are instrumental for highly optimized retail supply chains employing automation and techniques such as pack-by-store. When fulfilling a purchase order, a supplier may commit a fulfillment error, i.e., the supplier may fail to adhere to the terms specified by the retailer. The retailer may then penalize the supplier for the fulfillment error via a chargeback deduction, which reduces the supplier's revenue. We present a study of the fulfillment errors and chargebacks that occur in practice using data collected from a major retailer's distribution center. While fulfillment errors involving incorrect product quantities and delivery times have received the most attention in the literature, we find that the majority of fulfillment errors in the context we study involve documentation, bar coding, and retail ticketing. We refer to these as correctable fulfillment errors, since they are amended at the retailer's distribution center through rework. We develop a model of inventory management with correctable fulfillment errors and use the retailer's data to assess the cost of these correctable fulfillment errors to the retailer's inventory system. Our research provides guidance to managers in identifying products and suppliers that impose large fulfillment error costs as well as in setting appropriate chargebacks for fulfillment errors."
Managing contract manufacturer quality in the presence of performance ambiguity,John V. Gray,20 August 2015,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2015.08.002,"AbstractBrand-owing firms have been outsourcing the production of complete finished products to contract manufacturers (CMs) for some time. Increasingly, brand-owning firms have been employing CMs to produce products for which performance ambiguity is high. Doing so poses challenges for the management of CM performance. As expected, we find that quality performance ambiguity has a significant negative relationship with CM conformance quality performance, as reported by the buyers (the brand-owning firms). Drawing from and expanding the quality management (QM) literature, we assess the effectiveness of key constructs, derived primarily from the “supplier QM” meta-construct, at mitigating the detrimental effect of ambiguity. Two constructs consistently moderate the ambiguity-CM quality performance link. Heavily emphasizing quality at the time of CM selection moderates this relationship in the expected direction (i.e., it mitigates the challenges created by ambiguity). Surprisingly, we find that using one CM amplifies the negative relationship between ambiguity and conformance quality performance. One possible explanation is that employing only one CM aggravates existing opportunism concerns with regard to conformance quality performance under high levels of ambiguity."
Perceived versus actual value of product substitution flexibility: An experimental investigation,Saurabh Bansal,21 August 2015,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2015.08.001,"AbstractPrior literature suggests that in the presence of operational uncertainties such as uncertain demand, firms should deploy operational flexibilities. However, these flexibilities are costly to develop and a correct valuation of these capabilities is necessary to ensure that they are only deployed when the expected benefits exceed the cost. Using a set of behavioral decision-making experiments for inventory of substitutable products, we investigate how decision-makers perform when estimating the value of operational flexibility of product substitution. We found that subjects consistently overestimated the monetary value of product substitution. Furthermore, the overestimation became more acute as demand correlation increased. This behavior is not explained by risk aversion or random errors. Instead, it appears to be driven by fundamental and systematic behavioral biases when estimating the conjunctive probability of substitution. We suggest and validate a decomposition-based approach to mitigate this overestimation."
How firm innovativeness and unexpected product reliability failures affect profitability,Alan W. Mackelprang,25 June 2015,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2015.06.001,"AbstractThis study examines relationships among a firm’s innovativeness, its unexpected product failure costs, and financial performance. When a firm chooses to develop more innovative products and processes, product reliability outcomes become more uncertain. These uncertainties in turn may lead to unexpected warranty claims costs, as well as other costs that can erode the advantages of an innovation leadership position. This study empirically tests these propositions using publically reported warranty and financial data from 2003 to 2013, representing 482 unique firms. Consistent with prior studies, our estimation of the direct effects of firm innovativeness on financial performance shows an inverted–u–shaped relationship. Importantly, we find that more innovative firms also experience more unexpected product failure costs, and, consistent with organizational information processing theory, the negative impacts of these costs on financial performance extend well beyond the direct costs associated with remediating warranty claims. Further, we find that this relationship is robust to differing levels of industry innovativeness. Hence, our study suggests that product failure risks associated with firm innovativeness are significant, and act to at least partially offset the financial benefits of innovation leadership. In addition, standard accounting for product warranty claims may substantially understate the true costs associated with product failures, which appear to generate significant SG&A, fixed asset, and inventory costs above and beyond direct warranty processing costs. Our study also demonstrates a novel usage of warranty claims data. We discuss the implications of these findings for both managers and researchers."

Firm performance in dynamic environments: The role of operational slack and operational scope,Jeremy J. Kovach,04 May 2015,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2015.04.002,"AbstractThis study examines the effects of operational scope (breadth of product offering, extent of geographical diversification, and extent to which production processes can effectively meet varying demand) and operational slack (resources in excess of what is required to fulfill expected demand) on firm performance, contingent on two components of a firm's dynamic environment, unpredictability and instability. We collate quarterly data on 3857 publicly traded firms in 19 industries from the years 1991 to 2013 (representing 99,559 firm-quarter observations). Using panel data analysis, we find that narrow product offerings, low geographical diversification, low levels of excess capacity, and low inventory slack are each positively associated with firm performance. More importantly though, we find that operational scope is associated with improved performance in unpredictable environments, whereas operational slack is associated with improved performance in unstable environments. These findings contribute to the research on operations strategy by identifying the industry-specific environmental conditions under which operational slack and operational scope are associated with firm performance."
Team leader experience in improvement teams: A social networks perspective,George S. Easton,11 May 2015,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2015.05.001,"AbstractIn this research, we disentangle the relationship between several key aspects of a team leader's experience and the likelihood of improvement project success. Using the lens of socio-technical systems, we argue that the effect of team leader experience derives from the social system as well as the technical system. The aspects of team leader experience we examine include team leader social capital (a part of the social system) and team leader experience leading projects of the same type (a part of the technical system).We examine four different, yet related, dimensions of a team leader's social capital, which we motivate based on the social networks literature. One dimension, team leader familiarity, suggests that social capital is created when team leaders have experience working with current team members on prior improvement projects, and that such social capital increases the likelihood of improvement project success. We develop three additional dimensions, using social network analysis (SNA), to capture the idea that the improvement team leader's social capital extends beyond the current team to include everyone the leader has previously worked with on improvement projects. Contrasting our SNA-based dimensions with team leader familiarity enables us to better understand the impact of a team leader's social capital both inside and beyond the team. We also examine the effect of a team leader's experience leading prior projects of the same type, and consider the extent to which organizational experience may moderate the impact of both team leader social capital and same-type project experience.Based on analysis of archival data of six sigma projects spanning six years from a Fortune 500 consumer products manufacturer, we find that two of our SNA-based dimensions of team leader social capital, as well as experience leading projects of the same type, increase the likelihood of project success. In addition, we show that organizational experience moderates the relationship between team leader same-type project experience and project success. However, this is not the case for the relationship between the dimensions of team leader social capital and project success. These results provide insights regarding how dimensions of team leader experience and organizational experience collectively impact the operational performance of improvement teams."
A competitive advantage from the implementation timing of ISO management standards,Hung-Chung Su,17 April 2015,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2015.03.004,"AbstractWith the rise of globalization, firms increasingly implement management standards developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) to assure they can meet their customers’ expectations. ISO management standards reduce performance variability among suppliers and promote global trade. However, ISO standards also promote a certain degree of commonality or isomorphism between firms. If the very notion of ‘standards’ encourages a certain level of commonality between firms, then how can firms achieve a competitive advantage from implementing ISO standards? This research argues that thetimingof when a firm implements an ISO standard relative to their rivals has strategic benefits. Drawing on the competitive dynamics literature we argue that firms can achieve an early mover advantage when implementing ISO 14001. However, an early mover advantage depends on the level of a firm's absorptive capacity (prior experience with ISO 9001) and the competitive intensity of their industry. This study uses longitudinal data from firms that implemented ISO 14001 at varying points in time to examine the benefits of an early mover advantage. More broadly, this research sheds light onwhenfirms benefit the most from implementing new management standards. The results provide insights into implementing other emerging management standards."
Cultural embeddedness in supply networks,Zhaohui Wu,18 July 2015,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2015.06.004,"AbstractRecent studies on structural and relational embeddedness suggest that favorable position and connections in supply networks benefit a firm. While fruitful, this focus misses the motivations that prompt firms to take economic action in the first place. Understanding cultural embeddedness provides insight into why individuals and firms behave as they do and how their behavior can influence network structure. Contrary to the belief that firms act solely for profit and growth, we note that cultural contents such as values, social issues and political ideologies explain firms’ motives and guide their economic activities. We explore the role of cultural embeddedness through a grounded study of Country Natural Beef, a sustainability-oriented agricultural cooperative in the western United States. This supply network demonstrates strongly competing cultural claims among its members as well as a unique institutionalized culture. Cultural interactions at the node and network levels explain the functioning of and changes to the network. Through interviews, analysis of archival information and direct observation of pivotal events over a period of 5 years, we unpack cultural embeddedness and take an incremental step toward a theory of cultural embeddedness in cooperative supply networks."

Are safety and operational effectiveness contradictory requirements: The roles of routines and relational coordination,Mark Pagell,25 February 2015,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2015.02.002,"AbstractThe relationship between managing a production system to be safe and managing it to be operationally effective is often described in conflicting terms, creating confusion for research and practice. Some view improving safety as separate and distinct from increasing operational effectiveness; they are contradictory requirements. Others emphasize that safety and effectiveness are complementary, and combine to enhance competitiveness. Recent research proposes that this confusion can be explained by examining the operational and safety routines used in production. Specifically, when an organization chooses to manage safety and operations in a coordinated fashion using a joint management system, safety and operational effectiveness are complementary. Yet, the contradiction between safety and operations can occur when the functions are managed as separate and unequal silos. This research tests this supposition using the theory of relational coordination. The results, based on a combination of survey and archival safety data from 198 manufacturing firms, show that safety and operational outcomes are indirectly related via routines and that plants that manage safety and operations using a joint management system make these priorities complementary and do not create trade-offs between safety and operational performance."
"The impact of bullwhip on supply chains: Performance pathways, control mechanisms, and managerial levers",Alan W. Mackelprang,09 March 2015,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2015.02.003,"AbstractEven though few empirical studies have tried to actually explicate the relationship between the bullwhip effect and performance of the supplier firm, there exists a common perception for over 30 years among both practitioners and academics that the bullwhip effect naturally results in decreased firm profitability. Anecdotal evidence further suggests that this decline in profitability arises from a decline in operational performance. However, the results of our study, which empirically examines the bullwhip effect across supply chain partners through an analysis of 383 actual customer base-supplier dyads, challenge this commonly held position by suggesting that while traditional bullwhip often yields reduced ROA, it ultimately has no relationship with the firm's operating margin. Additionally, our results also call into question whether or not production coordination between customers and suppliers can minimize the need for inventory and capacity buffers, which are the two commonly utilized methods for battling the bullwhip effect. Thus the relationship between bullwhip and firm performance is far more nuanced and complicated than previously believed. We also show how the managerial bullwhip levers of coordinating production across supply chain partners, or deploying inventory and capacity buffer control mechanisms, can help maximize a firm's performance along different dimensions."
Effective judgmental forecasting in the context of fashion products⋆,Matthias Seifert,28 February 2015,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2015.02.001,"AbstractWe study the conditions that influence judgmental forecasting effectiveness when predicting demand in the context of fashion products. Human judgment is of practical importance in this setting. Our goal is to investigate what type of decision support, in particular historical and/or contextual predictors, should be provided to human forecasters to improve their ability to detect and exploit linear and nonlinear cue–criterion relationships in the task environment. Using a field experiment on new product forecasts in the music industry, our analysis reveals that when forecasters are concerned with predictive accuracy and only managerial judgments are employed, providing both types of decision support data is beneficial. However, if judgmental forecasts are combined with a statistical forecast, restricting the decision support provided to human judges to contextual anchors is beneficial. We identify two novel interactions demonstrating that the exploitation of nonlinearities is easiest for human judgment if contextual data are present but historical data are absent. Thus, if the role of human judgment is to detect these nonlinearities (and the linearities are taken care of by some statistical model with which judgments are combined), then a restriction of the decision support provided makes sense. Implications for the theory and practice of building decision support models are discussed."

Effects of control on the performance of information systems projects: The moderating role of complexity risk,Shan Liu,18 March 2015,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2015.03.003,"AbstractControl of projects is a core issue for organizations. Successful projects, such as information systems projects, enable organizations to develop a superior supply network and enhance the capability of operations management. A few studies have investigated the effects of control on project performance; however, complexity risk has not been integrated into the relationship between control and performance. Limited evidence has been provided concerning whether modes of control differ in their effectiveness in the presence of a single risk factor. Based on quantitative data obtained from 128 information systems projects, behavior, outcome, clan, and self-control are empirically determined to be positively associated with the system performance of projects. However, complexity risk generates a mixed moderating effect on the relationship between control and performance. In the presence of a high complexity risk, the effects of behavior and self-control on performance are low, whereas the effectiveness of outcome and clan control increases. This finding implies that complexity risk is a double-edged sword with regard to control. Each control mode exhibits different characteristics and effectiveness under high complexity risk. Therefore, appropriate control modes should be carefully selected, and highly effective control modes, such as outcome and clan control, should be prioritized in managing complex system projects.HighlightsControl modes are positively associated with the system performance of projects.Complexity risk differentially moderates the effectiveness of control.Behavior and self-control are ineffective under high complexity risk.Outcome and clan control are highly effective under high complexity risk."
The role of executive problem solving in knowledge accumulation and manufacturing improvements,Adrian S. Choo,11 March 2015,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2015.03.001,"AbstractThis study investigates how strategic leaders influence knowledge stocks and manufacturing improvements in firms. In doing so, we identify two related but distinct problem-solving orientations among senior executives. The first orientation uses short-term remedies to control and contain the impact of a problem, which we label as symptomatic problem solving (SPS). The other orientation addresses a problem situation with the objective of developing new understanding and skills, and we label it as generative problem solving (GPS). We test our theoretical framework using two waves of survey data from a sample of metal casting manufacturers (metal foundries) in the United States. Our analysis shows that GPS positively affects both internal and external knowledge stocks, while SPS negatively influences internal knowledge stock. Knowledge stocks, in turn, facilitate incremental and radical manufacturing improvements. Our results suggest that the two executive problem-solving orientations can potentially counteract each other in enhancing and depreciating knowledge stocks, and subsequently affect a manufacturer's ability to attain improvements both in the short and long terms"
Bullwhip effect under substitute products,Yongrui Duan,09 March 2015,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2015.03.002,"AbstractUsing a large-scale, product-level dataset collected from a supply chain dyad, we examine the effect of own and substitute products on a focal product's bullwhip effect and estimate the existence and magnitude of the bullwhip effect at the product level. We find that, under substitute products, the bullwhip effect is not only affected by a product's own factors but also by those of its substitute products. An increase in the number of own price changes is associated with a decrease in the bullwhip effect in terms of the direct effect but with an increase in the bullwhip effect in terms of the total effect, and increases in the number of price changes of substitute products and own stockouts are associated with increases in the bullwhip effect. The potential effects for own price changes, price changes of substitute products and own stockouts are as much as 59.51%, 95.06% and 66.11%. We also find that the bullwhip effect is prevalent and very intensive at the product level. We discuss the theoretical and managerial implications of the findings."
Implementing corporate lean programs: The effect of management control practices,Torbjørn H. Netland,24 March 2015,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2015.03.005,"AbstractWe examine how management control practices relate to the implementation of a corporate lean program at the factory level. Our empirical analysis uses data from a large manufacturing firm that is implementing a corporate lean program in its global plant network. We find that using dedicated teams to lead the lean program, developing and frequently reviewing lean-focused performance reports, and using nonfinancial rewards linked to lean implementation are favorably associated with more extensive implementation of lean practices in the factories. We do not find evidence that the use of management-initiated internal audits and financial rewards tied to lean implementation are strongly associated with more extensive lean implementation. We also present evidence of a positive relation between lean implementation and improvements in operational performance in the factories. Overall, these findings suggest that when implementing a corporate lean program, the firm must pay careful attention to the type of management control practices it uses for controlling the input, process, and output aspects of the lean program."
The impact of service design and process management on clinical quality: An exploration of synergetic effects⋆,Xin (David) Ding,06 April 2015,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2015.03.006,"AbstractWhile service design and process management have received research attention in the past, there is limited empirical work examining both factors in the hospital setting. Through operationalizing focus as a service design approach and quality improvement (QI) initiatives as process management efforts, we hypothesize that focus andQIinitiatives affect clinical quality both individually and collectively. Utilizing heart attack procedures as the study context, we examine a set of hypotheses based on a panel dataset consisted of 201 hospitals from 2005 to 2011 in the state of Florida. After accounting for potential lag effects and endogeneity biases, we find empirical support to the proposed hypotheses."

Financial benefits and risks of dependency in triadic supply chain relationships,Yoon Hee Kim,17 April 2015,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2015.04.001,"AbstractThe economic consequences of interdependent relationships with suppliers and customers have long been of interest to supply chain managers and academics alike. Whereas previous studies have focused on the benefits or risks of embedded relationships that accrue tobuying firms, this study simultaneously investigates the effects of asupplier'sand acustomer'sembeddedness, arising from resource dependency, on a focal firm's financial performance in triadic supply chain relationships. Using 1,144 unique focal firm-years for U.S. firms from Compustat, we find that a supplier's and a customer's dependency both increase the focal firm's performance in terms of return on assets (ROA) and return on sales (ROS) by increasing asset turnover (ATO). As levels of supplier and customer dependency on the focal firm increase, however, the economic benefits of customer dependency diminish beyond a certain point, while those of supplier dependency continue to increase above that threshold. Thus, our findings show the paradoxically differing risks of the supplier's versus the customer's dependency, while establishing the unequivocal economic benefits of supplier and customer relations for focal firms in the middle of concentrated triadic relationships."
Optimal pricing for new and remanufactured products,James D. Abbey,06 April 2015,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2015.03.007,"AbstractThis work investigates the optimal pricing of new and remanufactured products using a model of consumer preferences based on extensive experimentation. The experimental investigation reveals two distinct segments of consumers. One segment is relatively indifferent between new and remanufactured products and displays high sensitivity to price discounts. The second segment shows strong preferences for new products—with an accompanying aversion to remanufactured products—and realtively low sensitivity to price discounts. The pricing analysis examines several scenarios involving a new product manufacturer, ranging from a simple monopolist scenario to a more complex scenario involving competition with third-party remanufacturers. In contrast to the usual finding that new product prices should decrease when competitive remanufactured products enter the market, the introduction of market segments reveals a robust finding across all scenarios: when remanufactured products enter the market, the optimal price of the new product should increase. Through appropriate pricing of new products, the OEM can mitigate the effects of cannibalization and increase profitability."
Performance effects of using an ERP system for manufacturing planning and control under dynamic market requirements,Antti Tenhiälä,21 May 2014,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2014.05.001,"AbstractEnterprise resource planning (ERP) systems have a controversial reputation. Critics say that even if ERP systems may be beneficial for organizations operating in stable conditions, they are surely detrimental to organizations that face dynamic market requirements. This is because ERP systems are said to impose such procedures and constraints on organizations that make business processes inflexible to change. In contrast, proponents argue that the information-processing capabilities of ERP systems are crucial for organizations that face dynamic market requirements and also that the criticized procedures and constraints actually support process reengineering. These two contradictory arguments are often found in practitioner literature, but both of them can also be supported by management theory. The central tenets of the Organic Theory of organization design imply that ERP systems should be detrimental when market requirements change frequently, whereas the principles of Rigid Flexibility Theory suggest that they should be advantageous. In this study, we use cross-sectional data from 151 manufacturing plants to determine which argument is more applicable in the context of manufacturing planning and control. The results strongly favor the use of ERP systems under dynamic market requirements. To facilitate the reconciliation of the two contradictory arguments, we discuss how the results may have been influenced by two contextual factors: the predominantly technical nature of the studied organizational system and the tight interdependence of the studied activities."
How does technological diversity in supplier network drive buyer innovation? Relational process and contingencies,Gerald Yong Gao,10 June 2014,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2014.06.001,"AbstractExternal networks provide important knowledge sources of innovation for firms. Drawing on social network theory, this study examines how technological diversity in supplier network influences a focal buyer firm's innovation. The results from a survey of 202 Chinese manufacturing firms and their supplier networks reveal that novel information sharing partially mediates the effect of technological diversity in supplier network on buyer firms’ new product creativity. The positive effect of technological diversity is enhanced by buyer–supplier relational strength but inhibited by supplier network density; competitive intensity positively moderates this effect, and technological turbulence negatively moderates it. These findings provide novel insights into how buyer firms can use their supplier networks to enhance product innovation."
Problem-solving effort and success in innovation contests: The role of national wealth and national culture,Jesse Bockstedt,26 December 2014,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2014.12.002,"AbstractInnovation contests allow firms to harness specialized skills and services from globally dispersed participants for solutions to business problems. Such contests provide a rich setting for operations management (OM) scholars to explore problem solving in global labor markets as firms continue to unbundle their innovation value chains. In this study, we examine the implications of specific types of diversity in innovation contests on problem-solving effort and success. First, we conceptualize diversity among contestants in terms of national wealth (measured as gross domestic product per capita (GDPP) adjusted for purchasing power parity) and national culture (measured using the culture dimensions of performance orientation and uncertainty avoidance) and examine how such factors influence problem-solving effort. Next, we examine how differences between contestants and contest holders in terms of the above factors influence contest outcomes. Using data from a popular online innovation contest platform and country-level archival data, we find that contestants from countries with lower levels of GDPP are more likely to exert greater problem-solving effort compared to other contestants. With regard to national culture, we find that performance orientation and uncertainty avoidance have positive and negative effects, respectively, each of which weakens with increasing levels of GDPP. Finally, our analysis provides evidence of homophily effects indicating that contestants who share greater similarities with the contest holder in terms of national wealth and national culture are more likely to be successful in a contest. We discuss the implications of the study's findings for contest holders and platform owners who organize innovation contests, and for emerging research on innovation contests."
Understanding information exchange in healthcare operations: Evidence from hospitals and patients,David D. Dobrzykowski,13 January 2015,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2014.12.003,"AbstractCoordination – or the information exchange among physicians and hospital staff – is necessary for desirable patient outcomes in healthcare delivery. However, coordination is difficult because healthcare delivery processes are information intensive, complex and require interactions of hospitals with autonomous physicians working in multiple operational systems (i.e. multiple hospitals). We examine how three important variables distinctive of the healthcare operations context – use of IT for dissemination of test results (ITDR) (i.e. electronic health records systems) by physicians and hospital staff, social interaction ties among them, and physician employment – influence information exchange and patient perceptions of their care. Drawing from the literature on process inter-dependencies and coordination, vertical integration and social exchange, we develop and test research hypotheses linking ITDR, social interaction ties and physician employment to information exchange relationship, and information exchange relationship to provider–patient communication. Using a paired sample of primary survey data and secondary archival data from CMS HCAHPS for 173 hospitals in the USA, we find that increased information exchange relationship drives provider–patient communication, and increased social interaction ties drives information exchange relationship. Social interaction ties fully mediates the relationship between ITDR and information exchange relationship. Physician employment amplifies the link between ITDR and social interaction ties, but does not have an effect on the link between ITDR and information exchange. We do not find a direct relationship between ITDR, and information exchange relationship or provider–patient communication."
Structural drivers of upstream supply chain complexity and the frequency of supply chain disruptions,Christoph Bode,09 January 2015,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2014.12.004,"AbstractA great deal of research has focused on supply chain risk management, but the question “Which supply chain characteristics increase the frequency of supply chain disruptions?” has not received much attention from empirical research. This is a relevant question, because firms seek stability in their operations, and therefore managers need to know how the structure of their supply chains affects the occurrence of disruptions. The present study addresses this issue with a specific focus on upstream supply chain (supply-side) disruptions. Drawing on the literature on supply chain complexity, we devise and test a model that predicts the frequency of supply chain disruptions based on a multi-dimensional conceptualization of upstream supply chain complexity. Not only do the empirical findings suggest that all of the three investigated complexity drivers – horizontal, vertical, and spatial complexity – increase the frequency of disruptions, but also that they interact and amplify each other's effects in a synergistic fashion."
The effect of controversial global sourcing practices on the ethical judgments and intentions of U.S. consumers,Robert Bregman,13 January 2015,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2015.01.001,"AbstractGlobal sourcing has led to lower cost and more effective supply chains for many companies. However, when the cost-driven practices of many suppliers in these chains come to light there is often considerable debate over the ethics of these practices. This research uses the well-known Hunt–Vitell framework as the theoretical foundation for a structural equation model of the deontological and teleological evaluations used by consumers when making ethical judgments of a firm's controversial cost-driven global sourcing practices. Data from a large-scale U.S. consumer survey show the importance of deontological and teleological evaluations in forming consumers’ ethical judgments of global sourcing practices, and establish a strong relationship between ethical judgment and the intention of consumers to alter consumption of a firm's products. Extensions to the framework and demographic analyses for age, gender, and income provide insights as to how perceptions of these practices affect consumer evaluations of a company involved in global sourcing and how consumers actualize their resultant intentions."
Performance effects of early and late Six Sigma adoptions,Brian W. Jacobs,29 January 2015,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2015.01.002,"AbstractOperations managers confront the challenge of deciding when to implement various administrative innovations such as Six Sigma, ISO 9000, and Lean. This research examines the operating performance effects of early versus late adoption of Six Sigma process improvement. Using theories of organizational learning and knowledge transfer, we develop hypotheses describing the advantages of late adoption, and factors that affect a firm's ability to benefit from Six Sigma either as an early or late adopter. We test our hypotheses using an event study methodology. The empirical results show that, on average, late adopters in our sample enjoy significantly greater performance gains than early adopters. However, the analysis also shows that the advantages of late adopters tend to be moderated by certain environmental and structural characteristics of a firm. Specifically, late adoption has been favorable when firms operate in low-velocity industries, when they primarily sell in business-to-business markets, when they have good financial performance prior to adoption, and when they are large. Conversely, when adopters operate in conditions that have the opposite characteristics, then early adoption appears to have produced better results. Understanding the effects of these factors can enhance managers’ abilities to determine appropriate adoption timing to increase performance."
Supply chain management research: Key elements of study design and statistical testing,Catherine A. Helmuth,22 December 2014,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2014.12.001,"AbstractOver the past three decades, supply chain management (SCM) has evolved from its origins as a nascent field of study to encompass construct definition, identification of the field's central issues, and establishment of its conceptual boundaries. At this point, a sufficient body of empirical SCM research has been put forward to allow for quantitative assessment of the field. Therefore, we examine three key elements of study design to assess what has happened, what is currently happening, and where we should be heading as a field. To do so, following a pattern of reviews in similar disciplines, we begin with an examination of effect sizes of the relationships under investigation. Results show that effect sizes in SCM research have marginally increased over time and that sub-domains within SCM that receive the most scholarly attention also have higher effect sizes. We also conduct a post hoc analysis of statistical power and empirically examine a range of factors and study contexts that could influence power. Findings suggest that average statistical power in SCM research exceeds the statistical power of most related disciplines and is particularly high in several unique contexts. Lastly, we find that measurement reliability and the use of control variables have increased over time, possibly suggesting the field has matured, instilling a degree of confidence in its research. Overall, our results show that SCM research is becoming more empirically rigorous, but we also uncover key areas that warrant improvement. We describe implications of our review for the design of future SCM empirical studies."
Service triads: A research agenda for buyer–supplier–customer triads in business services,Finn Wynstra,16 October 2014,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2014.10.002,"AbstractService triads, in which a buyer contracts with a supplier to deliver services directly to the buyer's customer, represent an emerging business model. This special issue is dedicated to this theme. To set the context, in this lead article, we first define service triads, both as a phenomenon and a research topic. We then provide a review of different strands of existing research and various theoretical frameworks that can inform our study of service triads. This culminates in an outline of a research agenda that can guide future study. As such, this paper not only introduces the articles in the special issue, but is also intended as a point of reference and motivation for further work on service triads, and on triads in general."
Shareholder value implications of service failures in triads: The case of customer information security breaches,Sachin B. Modi,14 October 2014,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2014.10.003,"AbstractThe rise in front-end service outsourcing in recent years, despite its advantages, has also exposed buyer firms to unique challenges. One of the most salient risks for buyer firms in service triads is service failure due to the service provider. Indeed such service failures may be more costly for firms due to the greater relational and operational costs that may arise from the presence of the third-party provider. Yet, neither the services literature nor extant operations literature on service triads has paid much attention to the financial consequences to the buyer firm – i.e., service risks – of such service failures in triads. To fill this gap, we investigate the financial penalty of service failures due to the service provider using the event study methodology and a sample of 146 customer information security breaches as our empirical context. Analysis of the abnormal returns reveals that service failures due to the front-end service provider lead to greater shareholder losses than such failures due to the buyer firm. This provides important new insight into the financial risks arising from outsourcing front-end services. Further, we investigate the ability of the buyer firm's employee and financial resources to temper these shareholder losses. We find that buyer firm employee productivity can moderate the greater financial penalty associated with such triadic service failures but that buyer firm leverage tends to not have such a mitigating effect. This provides new guidance for theory and practice regarding how buyer firms can position themselves to buffer the financial risks arising from service failures due to front-end service providers."
Outsourcing customer support: The role of provider customer focus,Stefan Wuyts,14 October 2014,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2014.10.004,"AbstractAn increasing number of firms are outsourcing customer support to external service providers. This creates a triadic setting in which an outsourcing provider serves end customers on behalf of its clients. While outsourcing presents an opportunity to serve customers, service providers differ in their motivation and ability to fulfill customer needs. Prior research suggests that firms with a strong customer focus have an intrinsic motivation to address customer needs. We suggest that in an outsourcing context, this intrinsic motivation does not suffice. Using a Motivation–Opportunity–Ability framework, we posit that the effect of a provider's customer focus will be moderated by a set of relational, firm, and customer characteristics that affect its ability to serve end customers. We test our conceptualization among 171 outsourcing clients from the Netherlands and then validate these results among 135 Indian outsourcing providers. The findings reveal that customer-focused providers achieve higher levels of customer need fulfillment but this effect is contingent on their ability to serve end customers. In particular, customer-focused providers more effectively fulfill customer needs when clients and providers share close relational ties, when clients also have a high level of customer focus, and when end customer needs exhibit a low degree of turbulence. In addition, we find that, in turbulent markets, equipment-related services offer greater opportunity for effective customer need fulfillment than other outsourced services."
An agency perspective on service triads: Linking operational and financial performance,Jie J. Zhang,16 October 2014,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2014.10.005,"AbstractWe explore one prolific type of service triad, the franchise triad, involving three primary stakeholders: the franchisor, the franchisee and the customer. In this triad, franchisees use their affiliation with the franchisor's brand to attract customers to their local outlets. In exchange for the right of assuming the identity of the brand, the franchisee pays the franchisor royalties and retains residual profits. Applying Agency Theory, this paper examines the inherent conflict of interests between a principal (i.e., franchisor) that controls and manages brand equity as a shared resource and an agent (i.e., franchisee) that retains pricing right and profits from the identity of the brand by interacting directly with customers. We empirically isolate the effect of triad structure on outlet performance by matching two unique datasets. One set of data captures operational performance in the form of aggregated online review scores and the other financial performance including average daily hotel rate and revenue per available room. We find that franchisees charge higher prices than their corporate counterparts even when controlling for operational performance. Even though franchisees charge higher prices they maintain similar financial performance in terms of revenue per available room. These results suggest that the triad structure plays a significant role in franchisees’ ability to free-ride on shared brand equity and have important managerial implications for effective outsourcing, contract design and performance evaluation for a wide range of service industries."
Conducting and publishing design science research,Joan van Aken,01 July 2016,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2016.06.004,"AbstractThe new Design Science department at the Journal of Operations Management invites submissions using a design science research strategy for operations management (OM) issues. The objective of this strategy is to develop knowledge that can be used in a direct and specific way to design and implement actions, processes or systems aimed at achieving desired outcomes. This knowledge is developed by engaging with real-life OM problems or opportunities. Manuscripts submitted to this department will be evaluated on pragmatic validity and practical relevance. Because design science research (DSR) differs in some important aspects from other OM research strategies, this essay examines in some depth its challenges and possible solutions."
Partial least squares path modeling: Time for some serious second thoughts,Mikko Rönkkö,22 June 2016,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2016.05.002,"AbstractPartial least squares (PLS) path modeling is increasingly being promoted as a technique of choice for various analysis scenarios, despite the serious shortcomings of the method. The current lack of methodological justification for PLS prompted the editors of this journal to declare that research using this technique is likely to be desk-rejected (Guide and Ketokivi, 2015). To provide clarification on the inappropriateness of PLS for applied research, we provide a non-technical review and empirical demonstration of its inherent, intractable problems. We show that although the PLS technique is promoted as a structural equation modeling (SEM) technique, it is simply regression with scale scores and thus has very limited capabilities to handle the wide array of problems for which applied researchers use SEM. To that end, we explain why the use of PLS weights and many rules of thumb that are commonly employed with PLS are unjustifiable, followed by addressing why the touted advantages of the method are simply untenable."
The impact of firms’ social media initiatives on operational efficiency and innovativeness,Hugo K.S. Lam,15 July 2016,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2016.06.001,"AbstractSocial media have been increasingly adopted for organizational purposes but their operational implications are not well understood. Firms’ social media initiatives might facilitate information flow and knowledge sharing within and across organizations, strengthening firm-customer interaction, and improving internal and external collaboration. In this research we empirically examine the impact of social media initiatives on firms’ operational efficiency and innovativeness. Taking the resource-based view of firms’ information capability, we consider firms’ social media initiatives as strategic resources for operational improvement. We posit that firms’ social media initiatives enhance dynamic knowledge-sharing routines through an information-rich social network, leading to both operational efficiency and innovativeness. Collecting secondary data in a longitudinal setting from multiple sources, we construct dynamic panel data (DPD) models. Based on system generalized method of moments (GMM) estimation, we show that firms’ social media initiatives improve operational efficiency and innovativeness. We identify the importance of an information-rich social network to the creation of knowledge-based advantage through firms’ social media initiatives, and discuss the theoretical and managerial implications from the perspective of operations management."
Host government impact on the logistics performance of international humanitarian organisations,N. Dube,17 August 2016,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2016.05.011,"AbstractHost governments severely impact international relief operations. An openness to assistance can lead to the timely delivery of aid whereas a reluctance to receive assistance can have devastating consequences. With lives at stake and no time to lose in humanitarian crises, understanding the host government's impact on the logistics performance of international humanitarian organisations (IHOs) is crucial. In this paper, we present an in-depth multiple-case study that explores this aspect. Results show that host government actions are explained by their dependency on IHOs and the levels of tensions between their interests (i.e., conflicting strategic goals). In addition, a host government's regulatory and enforcement capabilities are important for ensuring that they can safeguard their interests. We derive four stances that host governments can adopt in regulating logistics-related activities: non-restrictive, opportunistic, selectively accommodating and uncompromising. Each of these has different implications for the logistics performance of IHOs."
Designing an efficient humanitarian supply network,Aurelie Charles,18 October 2016,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2016.05.012,"AbstractIncreasingly, humanitarian organizations have opened regional warehouses and pre-positioned resources locally. Choosing appropriate locations is not easy and frequently based on opportunities rather than rational decisions. Dedicated decision-support systems could help humanitarian practitioners design their supply networks. Academic literature suggests the use of commercial sector models but rarely considers the constraints and specific context of humanitarian operations, such as obtaining accurate data, high uncertainties, limited budgets and increasing pressure on cost efficiency. We propose a tooled methodology to properly support humanitarian decision makers in the design of their supply chains. Our contribution is based on the definition of aggregate scenarios to reliably forecast demand using past disaster data and future trends. Demand for relief items based on these scenarios is then fed to a mixed-integer linear programming model in order to improve current supply networks. The specifications of this model have been defined in close collaboration with humanitarian workers. The model allows analysis of the impact of alternative sourcing strategies and service level requirements on operational efficiency. It provides clear and actionable recommendations for a given context, bridging the gap between academics and humanitarian logisticians. The methodology was developed to be useful to a broad range of humanitarian organizations, and a specific application to the supply chain design of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies is discussed in detail."
Seeing the forest for the trees: Institutional environment impacts on reimbursement processes and healthcare operations,Seung Jun Lee,18 September 2016,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2016.09.001,"AbstractHealthcare reimbursement processes perform an annual multi-trillion dollar task to remunerate healthcare organizations, physicians, and patients. Healthcare reimbursement entails coding, billing, and payment processes based on care provided to patients. As this research note highlights, though often implicitly assumed to be independent of care delivery processes, reimbursement processes are distinctly connected to the efficacy of care delivery. Prior research tends to examine neither antecedents nor consequences of healthcare reimbursement processes and their operational implications, even though these issues can lead to unproductive externalities affecting healthcare systems and patients. Most extant literature tends to focus on medical task environments, with far less attention given to how institutional environment structures reimbursement and thus drives stakeholder incentives and behaviors. Because of a wide diversity of institutional environments, reimbursement processes differ on a nation-by-nation basis, and within nations on a state, province, city, or even within-city basis. The varied and complex reimbursement processes drive divergent stakeholder incentives, varying use of healthcare protocols and processes, and differing patient outcomes. Even within a single reimbursement regime, a multitude of reimbursement policies, required processes, and payer institutions creates operational complexity for physicians and their professional staff, which ultimately affects patient care delivery processes and outcomes. The task environment focus of extant healthcare OM research suggests a need to understand institutional environment antecedents, natures, and impacts of reimbursement processes. This research note illustrates the seemingly simple structural nature of reimbursement processes, yet also reminds researchers how diverse institutional environments, built to accomplish different healthcare aims, can lead to similar levels of enormous process complexity. The research note further motivates how such phenomena may affect research findings and the quest for operational solutions to healthcare dilemmas. By focusing on healthcare reimbursement and its operational implications, the note provides useful insights for continued studies of healthcare operations."
Co-creating value using customer training and education in a healthcare service design,Uzay Damali,30 November 2016,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2016.10.001,"AbstractIn services, which require significant customer participation to create value, customers who lack the knowledge, skills and motivation necessary to participate effectively can negatively impact service quality and cost outcomes. This paper develops a conceptual model to investigate the effectiveness of utilizing customer training and education (CTE) to improve customer readiness to provide effective behaviors in a professional service. The model was tested using survey data from patients diagnosed with diabetes who received CTE as part of their healthcare service. We found that customers who are taught why they have to perform the tasks, have higher levels of motivation to perform these tasks effectively. Further, as proposed by the customer readiness model, when their task performance is higher, they have improved health and lower healthcare costs."

"Examining the characteristics and managerial challenges of professional services: An empirical study of management consultancy in the travel, tourism, and hospitality sector",Alistair Brandon-Jones,02 April 2016,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2016.03.007,"AbstractThis paper finds that OM's ‘one-size-fits-all’ characterization of professional services, namely high levels of customer engagement, extensive customization, knowledge intensity, and low levels of capital intensity, does not hold when carrying out a ‘deep dive’ (to the best of our knowledge, a first in this area of OM) into consultancy in the US travel, tourism, and hospitality sector. We analyse mixed-method data (semi-structured interviews, focus groups, and a best–worst choice experimental survey) and observe that consultancy can actually be quite remote and passive and that any periods of face-to-face ‘engagement’ will typically be time limited and focused on specific project phases. Moreover, and further confirming the value of a study that allowed us to investigate professional service operations in a specific market context, our data suggest this may often be at the behest of the client. The significant variation observed in levels of customization we interpret as confirming Maister's (1993) notion of a portfolio ofbrains,grey hair, andproceduralwork. We also observed relatively high levels of capital intensity; reflecting perhaps the vintage of most OM characterizations and the dramatic ICT-related changes that have occurred inallbusiness operations in the last 20 years. The work also demonstrates the necessity of a more contingent perspective on PSOM. We assess the impact of both firm (scale, specialization) and individual level (leverage) characteristics to demonstrate significant variation within what might be expected to be a relatively homogenous group of professional service operations. For example, investigating the effects of specialization (via a typology of consulting operations: super-specialists, generalists, deep knowledge traders, deep market knowledge traders) revealed that relative degree of interaction may be dependent upon degree of expertise, such that it was thesuper-specialistsin our sample that spent less time with clients and the moregeneralistfirms who were complementing their limited expert status with high levels of interaction (networking, etc.)."
A life-cycle perspective of professionalism in services,Benjamin Lawrence,29 March 2016,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2016.03.003,"AbstractIn this article, we develop a professional service life cycle model to describe the changes in professional work over time. We explore the drivers of these changes through an in-depth longitudinal case study of one specific professional service – Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design (LEED) consulting. We focus on understanding the evolutionary path of LEED consulting work as a result of its knowledge base, community and response to market and technological forces. Case evidence demonstrates an inherent tension between innovation and commodification resulting from multiple demands through various developmental stages. The life cycle model has important implications for value-creation in professional service operations management. First, it broadens the theoretical investigation of professional services to consider all processes and people along the professional continuum – from most innovative to commodified. Coordinated effort along the professional continuum is the key to delivering both effectiveness and efficiency. Second, proactively managing the transitions along the evolutionary path is both possible and desirable. Standardization and specialization improve talent allocation and boost future innovation. We suggest future opportunities to test and enrich the model."
Examining pathways to safety and financial performance in hospitals: A study of lean in professional service operations,David D. Dobrzykowski,28 March 2016,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2016.03.001,"AbstractHealthcare operates in a complex professional service environment that faces challenges in delivering high quality and affordable care – a set of goals that some healthcare professionals believe are incongruous. To consider opportunities to achieve these important outcomes, this study examines the relationships among comprehensive lean orientation, internal integration, patient safety, and financial performance. This study draws on the professional services operations (PSOs) literature stream to explain and offer a means of addressing the complexity of healthcare delivery. Grounded in dynamic capabilities, this study develops a model for improving financial performance and patient safety in hospitals. Using structural equation modeling, the model is tested with survey data from 211 acute care hospitals in the USA that are matched with data from two other sources – objective patient safety data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and objective net income data from the American Hospital Directory. Results indicate that although a comprehensive lean orientation has a direct and positive impact on patient safety, it impacts financial performance indirectly through internal integration. The results have major implications for enhancing patient safety and financial performance in healthcare service organizations, and improving operations in PSOs more broadly."
Professional service supply chains⋆,Jean Harvey,04 April 2016,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2016.03.002,"AbstractProfessional service (PS) exchanges are seldom narrowly bounded in time and space.

It is framed by the dual concepts of service episodes, representing the client's perspective and experience, and PS supply chains, that is, organized sequences of professional, clerical, and technical services explicitly set up to provide specific results, such as producing a financial product, designing a house, or replacing a hip. Four illustrative, empirically inspired situations are used to characterize episodes and supply chains. Each exemplar, two each from the health and social work sectors, is real and draws on publicly available data. The richness of the public information is a reflection of the fact that each is some form of failure or “disaster” (Altay and Ramirez, 2010). This dual conceptualization leads to a holistic perspective obtained by using the complex adaptive systems framework (Dooley and Van de ven, 1999, Levin, 1998) as a lens.

Collaboration between service professionals during the delivery of health care: Evidence from a multiple-case study in U.S. hospitals,Claire Senot,06 April 2016,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2016.03.004,"AbstractWe investigate service delivery in one specific type of professional service firms (PSF), namely hospitals. A distinctive operational feature of this setting is that the delivery of health care services requires continuous collaboration between two professional workforces: physicians and nurses. We conducted a multiple-case study at five acute care U.S. hospitals, which involved 49 semi-structured interviews, to uncover the organizational mechanisms that facilitate effective collaboration between physicians and nurses. Our analyses suggest that they experience distinct challenges that prevented collaboration during health care delivery. Specifically, physicians typically favored evidence-based standards of care which can sometimes undermine patient interactions. We refer to this preference as a disease-focus challenge. We also found that nurses were often hesitant to speak-up during their interactions with the physicians, which constitute a hierarchical challenge. Commonly prescribed mechanisms, such as multi-disciplinary rounding, were not effective in overcoming these challenges. Our analyses revealed new forms of collaboration between different levels of the physician and nursing entities, which we denote as “nursing-led cross-level collaboration” and “physician-led cross-level collaboration”. Our study suggests that nursing-led cross-level collaboration helped mitigate the disease-focus challenge experienced by physicians while physician-led cross-level collaboration helped mitigate the hierarchical challenge experienced by nurses. It also offers preliminary insights on how PSF in general can develop and sustain such collaboration. Taken together, our findings offer new insights on the micro-foundations of work performed by PSF."
Global engineering services: Shedding light on network capabilities,Yufeng Zhang,21 March 2016,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2016.03.006,"AbstractThis paper addresses the operations challenges of effectively managing professional services on a global scale. The specific context for the study is professional engineering services and particularly those that are delivered globally – global engineering services (GES). Estimates suggest that the market for GES was around US$930 billion in 2012, rising to US$1.4 trillion by 2020 (ISG, 2013). Yet this influential sector receives scant attention in the operations management literature. The paper draws on six case studies to explore the operations management challenges of delivering GES. In doing so the paper introduces the concept of network capabilities for GES, highlighting the centrality that: (i) network resources – accessing and deploying dispersed resources, (ii) network coordination – coordinating and integrating network activities, and (iii) network learning – collective learning and knowledge management, all play in enabling the successful operational management of GES."

Erratum to ‘Inventory record inaccuracy: Causes and labor effects’,Howard Hao-Chun Chuang,18 March 2016,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2016.01.002,"AbstractInventory record inaccuracy (IRI) is a pervasive problem in retailing and causes non-trivial profit loss. In response to retailers’ interest in identifying antecedents and consequences of IRI, we present a study that comprises multiple modeling initiatives. We first develop a dynamic simulation model to compare and contrast impacts of different operational errors in a continuous (Q,R) inventory system through a full-factorial experimental design. While backroom and shelf shrinkage are found to be predominant drivers of IRI, the other three errors related to recording and shelving have negligible impacts on IRI. Next, we empirically assess the relationships between labor availability and IRI using longitudinal data from five stores in a global retail chain. After deriving a robust measure of IRI through Bayesian computation and estimating panel data models, we find strong evidence that full-time labor reduces IRI whereas part-time labor fails to alleviate it. Further, we articulate the reinforcing relationships between labor and IRI by formally assessing the gain of the feedback loop based on our empirical findings and analyzing immediate, intermediate, and long-term impacts of IRI on labor availability. The feedback modeling effort not only integrates findings from simulation and econometric analysis but also structurally explores the impacts of current practices. We conclude by discussing implications of our findings for practitioners and researchers."

Role hazard between supply chain partners in an institutionally fragmented market,Maggie Chuoyan Dong,14 September 2016,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2016.07.006,"AbstractA major challenge to supply chain management in emerging markets is the relational coordination problem arising from variations in sub-national institutions in which partners are situated. This study investigates role hazard, a critical yet understudied relational coordination problem. Drawing on role and institutional theories, we examine role ambiguity and role conflict as two facets of role hazard between buyer and supplier, their institutional source, performance outcomes, and firms’ action alignment mechanisms as potential remedies. A dyadic survey of buyers and suppliers in China reveals that both role ambiguity and role conflict can result from sub-national institutional distance and jeopardize supply chain performance. The results also suggest that supply chain partners in different sub-national institutions can mitigate role hazard through continuous information sharing and dynamic adaptation. This study provides novel insights into how buyers and suppliers can enhance their relational coordination in emerging markets by reducing role hazard caused by sub-national institutional distance."
Social management capabilities of multinational buying firms and their emerging market suppliers: An exploratory study of the clothing industry,Fahian Anisul Huq,08 September 2016,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2016.07.005,"AbstractFor sustainability, research in operations and supply chain management historically emphasized the development of environmental rather than social capabilities. However, factory disasters in Bangladesh, an emerging market and the second largest clothing exporter in the world, revealed enormous challenges in the implementation of social sustainability in complex global supply chains. Against the backdrop of a building collapse in Bangladesh's clothing industry, this research uses multiple case studies from two time periods to explore the skills, practices, relationships and processes – collectively termed “social management capabilities” (SMCs) – that help buyers and suppliers respond to stakeholder pressures; address regulatory gaps; and improve social performance. The study not only captures the perspectives of both multinational buyers and their emerging market suppliers, but also provides supplementary evidence from other key stakeholders, such as NGOs and unions. Our findings show that, in the absence of intense stakeholder pressure, buyers can lay the foundation for improved social performance by using their own auditors and collaborating with suppliers rather than using third-party auditors. However, in the face of acute attention from customers, NGOs and media, we observed that consultative buyer-consortium audits emerged, and shared third-party audits offered other advantages such as increased transparency and improvements in worker education and training. Finally, we present research propositions derived from our empirical study to guide future research on implementing social sustainability in emerging markets."
Contract ineffectiveness in emerging markets: An institutional theory perspective⋆,Zhigang Shou,12 August 2016,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2016.07.004,"AbstractThe effectiveness of contracts is bounded by the institutional environment in which they are designed and enforced. When firms form supply chain partnerships in emerging markets, they may experiencecontract ineffectiveness, which is defined as a firm's perceived limits of contracts with respect to safeguarding interests and coordinating activities. Specifically, we identify two institutional factors that may give rise to contract ineffectiveness, information transparency and legal enforceability, as they determine how effectively a firm designs and enforces a contract. In addition, we reveal that contract ineffectiveness prompts a firm to seek social ties, including business ties and political ties, to overcome the institutionally induced limits of contracts. These efforts, however, are moderated by the type of predominant pressure a firm bears. While equity pressure strengthens the relationship between contract ineffectiveness and a firm's pursuit of social ties, efficiency pressure weakens this relationship, because seeking social ties imposes an extra burden of efficiency. Tested by data collected from 187 distributors in China, our study reveals the institutional causes and the consequences of contract ineffectiveness, which is a common problem encountered by firms when forming supply chain partnerships in emerging markets."

"Emerging market presence, inventory, and product recall linkages",Adams B. Steven,03 August 2016,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2016.07.003,"AbstractThis study investigates simultaneous linkages between outsourcing, in-house offshoring, sales to emerging markets, inventory and product recalls. The study finds a positive and significant association between outsourcing to emerging markets and recalls and that sales penetration into emerging markets reduces recalls; however, it finds no direct relationship between in-house offshoring and recalls. Interestingly, in-house offshoring to emerging markets appears to mitigate the positive relationship between outsourcing to these markets and recalls; this suggests that transactional complexities of outsourcing to emerging markets are mitigated by a physical presence in the market. This important finding suggests that by keeping some operations in-house, firms may reduce the negative effect of outsourcing on product quality and safety while reaping low-cost benefits of sourcing from these emerging markets. Additionally, the results indicate that institutional immaturities within recipient countries (associated with outsourcing) are primary contributors to inefficiencies affecting quality performance. On the inventory side, sourcing from emerging markets negatively affects inventory performance. Although inventory performance typically does not appear to be related to recalls, finished goods inventory is positively associated with quality failures."
Product co-development in an emerging market: The role of buyer-supplier compatibility and institutional environment,Jeff Jianfeng Wang,07 August 2016,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2016.07.002,"AbstractIn emerging markets, supply chains increasingly serve as critical value chains through which ideas, practices and knowledge flow to and from suppliers and buyers. Drawing on buyer-supplier collaboration literature and organizational learning theory, we examine the antecedents and underlying mechanisms of product co-development. Due to emerging markets' unique institutional environments, we further investigate how government intervention and guanxi importance moderate supplier-buyer collaborative outcomes. Dyadic data from 323 supplier-buyer pairs in China largely support our theoretical framework. Partners' knowledge commonality has a curvilinear (inverted U-shaped) relationship to product co-development, whereas goal compatibility has a positive impact on product co-development. Mutual learning partially mediates the main effect. Furthermore, government intervention weakens the positive effect of mutual learning on product co-development whereas guanxi importance strengthens this relationship. This research provides fresh theoretical and managerial implications to supply chain collaboration in emerging markets."
Governing local supplier opportunism in China: Moderating role of institutional forces,Mengyang Wang,04 August 2016,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2016.07.001,"AbstractChina provides a vast and prominent manufacturing base, so curtailing its local supplier opportunism represents a primary concern for local and foreign buyers. Drawing on institutional theory, this study examines how regulatory uncertainty and relationship structure moderate the role of contracts and trust in restricting local supplier opportunism in China. An analysis of 293 buyer–supplier dyads in China reveals that contracts are more effective in deterring supplier opportunism when regulatory uncertainty is high. In addition, contracts help curtail opportunism more in domestic, compared with international, buyer–supplier relationships, whereas trust is more effective in restricting supplier opportunism in international relationships than in domestic ones."

Models and metrics to assess humanitarian response capacity,Jason Acimovic,26 July 2016,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2016.05.003,"AbstractThe race to meet vital needs following sudden onset disasters leads response organizations to establish stockpiles of inventory that can be deployed immediately. These government or non-government organizations dynamically make stockpile decisions independently. Even though the value of one organization's stock deployment is contingent on others' decisions, decision makers lack evidence regarding sector capacity to assess the marginal contribution (positive or negative) of their action. To our knowledge, there exist no metrics describing the system capacity across many agents to respond to disasters. To address this gap, our analytical approach yields new humanitarian logistics metrics based on stochastic optimization models. Our study incorporates empirical data on inventory stored by various organizations in United Nations facilities and in their own warehouses to offer practical insights regarding the current humanitarian response capabilities and strategies. By repositioning inventory already deployed, the system could respond to disasters in the same expected time with a range of 7.4%–20.0% lower cost for the items in our sample."
Disentangling the efficiency drivers in country-level global health programs: An empirical study,Gemma Berenguer,04 July 2016,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2016.05.005,"AbstractMotivated by the cost reductions and outcome improvements generated by benchmarking in many industries, we focus on in-country global health programs to identify and quantify opportunities for process improvement. We empirically study the major efficiency drivers of reproductive health (RH) country programs in Sub-Saharan Africa sponsored by international funding organizations. To ensure a level playing field for comparison across countries, we quantify the impact of cross-country heterogeneity and random shocks on the efficiency of RH programs. To analyze these relationships and isolate the effects attributable to managerial inefficiency, we use a three-stage Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA)/Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) model. We show the impact of environmental factors on program efficiency, linking policy making decisions with operational and health outcome performance. We also show that donor fragmentation negatively impacts managerial efficiency, and we suggest actions to mitigate this effect. We then provide a way to improve performance through benchmarking efforts within groups of countries and present an initial prototype of such efforts."
Econometric estimation of deprivation cost functions: A contingent valuation experiment,José Holguín-Veras,30 June 2016,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2016.05.008,"AbstractThis paper details research to design an estimation process for Deprivation Cost Functions (DCF) using Contingent Valuation, and to apply it econometrically to obtain a DCF for drinkable water. The paper describes both the process and results obtained. The results indicate that deprivation costs for drinkable water have a non-linear relation with deprivation times. The estimated DCFs provide a consistent metric that could be incorporated into humanitarian logistic mathematical models, eliminating the need to use proxy metrics, and providing a better way to assess the impacts of delivery options and actions. The research reported in this paper is the first attempt in the literature to produce estimates of the economic value of human suffering created by the deprivation of a critical supply or service."
Integrating supply chains for emergencies and ongoing operations in UNHCR,Marianne Jahre,01 August 2016,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2016.05.009,"AbstractHumanitarian organizations (HOs) often base their warehouse locations on individuals' experience and knowledge rather than on decision-support tools. Many HOs run separate supply chains for emergency response and ongoing operations. Based on reviews of humanitarian network design literature combined with an in-depth case study of United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), this paper presents a warehouse location model for joint prepositioning that incorporates political and security situation factors. Although accessibility, co-location, security, and human resources are crucial to the practice of humanitarian operations management, such contextual factors have not been included in existing network optimization models before. We found that when quantified, and modeled, such factors are important determinants of network configuration. In addition, our results suggest that joint prepositioning for emergency response and ongoing operations allows for expansion of the global warehouse network, and reducing cost and response time."

Using as a case study the Colombian conflict we investigate the effect of conflict on public rural hospitals' (i) total factor productivity, (ii) efficiency and (iii) efficiency variability. The panel data set (2007–2011) used in this study includes information at the hospital level for 163 hospitals and qualitative data collected from interviews with medical staff from the Colombian Ministry of Health and hospitals in different conflict zones. Our results indicate that armed conflict has a positive effect on total factor productivity, while it has a negative impact on hospital efficiency, and interestingly that efficiency and total factor productivity both increase in post conflict. Finally, the results show that efficiency variability is higher in peace and post-conflict hospitals and lower in medium and severe-conflict hospitals. These results have operations management implications and opportunities for future research related to sourcing decisions, supply chain and workforce flexibility, behavioral impacts on the workforce, and humanitarian response to conflicts."
Supporting hurricane inventory management decisions with consumer demand estimates,Douglas J. Morrice,09 July 2016,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2016.05.006,"AbstractMatching supply and demand can be very challenging for anyone attempting to provide goods or services during the threat of a natural disaster. In this paper, we consider inventory allocation issues faced by a retailer during a hurricane event and provide insights that can be applied to humanitarian operations during slow-onset events. We start with an empirical analysis using regression that triangulates three sources of information: a large point-of-sales data set from a Texas Gulf Coast retailer, the retailer's operational and logistical constraints, and hurricane forecast data from the National Hurricane Center (NHC). We establish a strong association between the timing of the hurricane weather forecast, the forecasted landfall position of the storm, and hurricane sales. Storm intensity is found to have a weaker association on overall inventory decisions. Using the results of the empirical analysis and the NHC forecast data, we construct a state-space model of demand during the threat of a hurricane and develop an inventory management model to satisfy consumer demand prior to a hurricane making landfall. Based on the structure of the problem, we model this situation as a two-stage, two-location inventory allocation model from a centralized distribution center that balances transportation, shortage and holding costs. The model is used to explore the role of recourse, i.e., deferring part of the inventory allocation until observing the state of the hurricane as it moves towards landfall. Our approach provides valuable insights into the circumstances under which recourse may or may not be worthwhile in any setting where an anticipated extreme event drives consumer demand."
"Natural disasters, the economy and population vulnerability as a vicious cycle with exogenous hazards",ManMohan S. Sodhi,30 June 2016,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2016.05.010,"AbstractOne way to understand the growing impact of disasters is as the output of a positive feedback, or reinforcing, loop. This paper hypothesizes that population vulnerability of a country transforms exogenous hazards to disaster impact for that country, which negatively impacts its economy as measured by per capita income and its growth. This impact in turn increases the vulnerability of the country's population thus creating a reinforcing loop. Therefore, like the output of any positive feedback loop, disaster impact would grow exponentially. Having analysed data over 50 years (1963–2012) and 179 countries, we find the results to be consistent with this conceptual model. We also find that disaster impact worldwide has indeed grown exponentially over this period even after normalizing for the growing global population and global income. These findings indicate the existence of a feedback loop that requires strategic rethinking about disaster management and development jointly to break this vicious cycle."
Demand forecasting and order planning for humanitarian logistics: An empirical assessment,Erwin van der Laan,15 July 2016,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2016.05.004,"AbstractHumanitarian aid organizations are most known for their short-term emergency relief. While getting aid items to those in need can be challenging, long-term projects provide an opportunity for demand planning supported by forecasting methods. Based on standardized consumption data of the Operational Center Amsterdam of Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF-OCA) regarding nineteen longer-term aid projects and over 2000 medical items consumed in 2013, we describe and analyze the forecasting and order planning process. We find that several internal and external factors influence forecast and order planning performance, be it indirectly through demand volatility and safety markup. Moreover, we identify opportunities for further improvement for MSF-OCA, and for humanitarian logistics organizations in general."
Evaluating information diffusion speed and its determinants in social media networks during humanitarian crises,Eunae Yoo,09 July 2016,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2016.05.007,"AbstractThe rapid diffusion of information is critical to combat the extreme levels of uncertainty and complexity that surround disaster relief operations. As a means of gathering and sharing information, humanitarian organizations are becoming increasingly reliant on social media platforms based on the Internet. In this paper, we present a field study that examines how effectively information diffuses through social media networks embedded in these platforms. Using a large dataset from Twitter during Hurricane Sandy, we first applied Information Diffusion Theory to characterize diffusion rates. Then, we empirically examined the impact of key elements on information propagation rates on social media. Our results revealed that internal diffusion through social media networks advances at a significantly higher speed than information in these networks coming from external sources. This finding is important because it suggests that social media networks are effective at passing information along during humanitarian crises that require urgent information diffusion. Our results also indicate that dissemination rates depend on the influence of those who originate the information. Moreover, they suggest that information posted earlier during a disaster exhibits a significantly higher speed of diffusion than information that is introduced later during more eventful stages in the disaster. This is because, over time, participation in the diffusion of information declines as more and more communications compete for attention among users."
Fleet management policies for humanitarian organizations: Beyond the utilization–residual value trade-off,Mahyar Eftekhar,24 May 2016,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2016.03.008,"AbstractFour-wheel drive vehicles play a pivotal role in securing the last-mile distribution of goods and services in humanitarian development programs. To optimize the use of their fleets, humanitarian organizations recommend policies aimed at enhancing the utilization of vehicles while preserving residual value. Although these decisions have a significant impact on cost, there is limited empirical evidence to show that the recommended policies are actually implemented and that they produce the expected benefits. This paper theoretically and empirically examines the complex and inter-related effects of vehicle-to-mission allocation decisions and of alternative vehicle usage patterns on vehicle utilization and residual value in humanitarian development programs. The results suggest that humanitarian organizations could break the utilization–residual value trade-off by adopting different policies than the ones currently in place. They also reveal that organizations need to realize that what seems logical from the headquarters' perspective may be illogical or inconvenient for the field, and as a result, the field may do the opposite of what is recommended or even instructed. Therefore, they either need better data and analysis combined with audits or they need to improve mechanisms that incentivize field delegations to follow standards recommended by the headquarters."
The configuration between supply chain integration and information technology competency: A resource orchestration perspective,Hefu Liu,24 May 2016,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2016.03.009,"AbstractResearch indicates that deploying appropriate information technology (IT) competency in a manner that fits the supply chain integration (SCI) of a firm induces superior firm performance; however, our understanding of how to empirically conceptualize and assess the performance effect of the fit remains limited. Drawing upon resource orchestration theory and the literature on fit assessment methodologies, our study employs both a contingency and a configuration perspective to conceptualize and operationalize “fit.” The results of a survey of 196 firms in China provide the first empirical evidence for the existence and nature of interrelationships between multiple components of SCI and IT competency and their effects on firm performance. In particular, fit as “moderation” approach indicates that IT competency could strengthen the relationship between SCI and both operational and financial performance. Fit as “profile deviation” approach further reveals that the more similar the IT competency configurations are to those of the top performers in the high-level SCI group, the higher their operational and financial performance are. However, in the medium- and low-level SCI groups, the SCI-IT competency fit is significantly positively associated with financial performance and insignificantly associated with operational performance. The theoretical contributions and managerial implications of the study are discussed."
Supply chain risk management and hospital inventory: Effects of system affiliation,E. David Zepeda,16 May 2016,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2016.04.002,"AbstractIn this study we examine the effects of horizontal inter-organizational arrangements on inventory costs for hospitals facing two key environmental conditions, namely the logistics services infrastructure where the hospital is located and the demand uncertainty for clinical requirements that a hospital experiences. Utilizing detailed data from hospitals in the State of California, we investigated the potential mitigating effects of affiliation with multi-hospital systems while controlling for service performance. We argue that these arrangements potentially influence managers' confidence in their supply chains, which in turn impacts inventory accumulation. Results suggest that while affiliation with local, regional, and national systems has mitigating effects under weak logistics services infrastructure, the mitigating effect is greatest for affiliation in local systems. The results also point to potential for improved operating efficiency with system affiliation, a factor that is often not considered in policy discussions regarding hospital system formation. Theoretical and managerial implications are discussed."
The appointment of chief supply chain officers to top management teams: A contingency model of firm-level antecedents and consequences,Joseph Roh,11 May 2016,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2016.05.001,"AbstractThis study investigates the recent emergence of Chief Supply Chain Officers (CSCOs). Drawing on contingency theory, we analyze firm-level antecedents and consequences associated with CSCOs being appointed to top management teams (TMTs). We conceptually develop the role of CSCOs and hypothesize that CSCOs are most likely to be appointed to TMTs at firms where supply chain-related integration and differentiation pressures are high. The results from a matched sample of S&P 1500 firms over a 21-year period reveal that financial leverage, internationalization, and diversification all predict CSCO appointment to the TMT. Our results also suggest that these same contingencies positively moderate the effect of CSCO presence on firm performance, with CSCOs proving beneficial when leverage, internationalization, and diversification levels are high, but detrimental when leverage, internationalization, and diversification are low. In addition, we find post-hoc evidence that suggests institutional forces may also be a factor in CSCO appointments. Our results reveal that most of the contingency performance effects manifest only for early adopters of the CSCO role, suggesting that late-mover elevation of the supply chain function to the TMT is a form of mimetic isomorphism. This study extends research on CSCOs and their emergence in TMTs, as well as the role of operations management in corporate strategy."
Determining an optimal hierarchical forecasting model based on the characteristics of the data set: Technical note,Zlatana D. Nenova,28 April 2016,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2016.04.001,"AbstractThe efficient flow of goods and services involves addressing multilevel forecast questions, and careful consideration when aggregating or disaggregating hierarchical estimates. Assessing all possible aggregation alternatives helps to determine the statistically most accurate way of consolidating multilevel forecasts. However, doing so in a multilevel and multiproduct supply chain may prove to be a very computationally intensive and time-consuming task. In this paper, we present a new, two-level oblique linear discriminant tree model, which identifies the optimal hierarchical forecast technique for a given hierarchical database in a very time-efficient manner. We induced our model from a real-world dataset, and it separates all historical time series into the four aggregation mechanisms considered. The separation process is a function of both the positive and negative correlation groups' variances at the lowest level of the hierarchical datasets. Our primary contributions are: (1) establishing a clear-cut relationship between the correlation metrics at the lowest level of the hierarchy and the optimal aggregation mechanism for a product/service hierarchy, and (2) developing an analytical model for personalized forecast aggregation decisions, based on characteristics of a hierarchical dataset."
The selection of contracts in supply chains: An empirical analysis,Stephan Sluis,24 November 2015,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2015.10.002,"AbstractThis paper seeks to empirically identify the key drivers for firms in selecting a contract in a supply chain by investigating their performance, supply chain orientation, and supply chain integration. A conceptual model is drawn up based on the existing literature in supply chain coordination contracts, performance, supply chain orientation, and supply chain integration and tested on a large sample of European firms. Multiple and multinomial logistic regression models allow for estimating the relationships between these variables. Our results demonstrate that the selection of contracts and the probability of their adoption depend on several combinations of firms' performance, supply chain orientation, and integration. Overall, the research provides an empirical contribution to the literature on coordination with contracts, which turns out to be mainly game theory based.HighlightsPerformance only explains the implementation of quantity-based contracts.Supply chain (SC) integration helps to achieve lots of quantity-based contracts.SC integration does not justify the adoption of any price-based contract.SC orientation predicts the usage of all price-based contracts.SC orientation only entails the adoption of few quantity-based contracts."
Contract governance and buyer–supplier conflict: The moderating role of institutions,Xuan Bai,24 November 2015,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2015.10.003,"AbstractDrawing on contract governance literature and institutional theory, this study investigates the differential effects of output- and behavior-based contract governance on buyer–supplier conflict in supply chains. The authors develop a contingent perspective to examine how institutional factors moderate the impact of contract governance. The findings, from an empirical study of buyer–supplier dyads in China, show that an output-based contract is negatively, whereas a behavior-based contract is positively, related to buyer–supplier conflict. The effects of a contract are moderated by two primary institutional factors: legal enforceability and unilateral government support. These findings have important implications for supply chain research, public policy, and managerial practice."
The impact of Health Information Technology bundles on Hospital performance: An econometric study,Luv Sharma,01 December 2015,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2015.10.001,"AbstractHospitals are characterized by high levels of technical expertise as well as patient interactions. In an attempt to improve their performance along these dimensions, hospitals are making significant investments in health information technologies (HIT). However, the performance benefits from these investments are largely unknown. This study employs a portfolio approach to study HIT adoption using a large longitudinal panel data for 3615 US hospitals from 2007 to 2012. Insights from the Advanced Manufacturing Technology (AMT) and existing HIT literature are used to categorize 76 HITs into 3 distinct bundles based on their extent of patient centered integration, and the extent of caregiver interaction. We then examine how two key HIT bundles: Clinical HIT (defined as HIT systems primarily used for patient data collection, diagnosis and treatment) and Augmented Clinical HIT (defined as HIT systems primarily used for integrating patient information and augmenting decision making capability of caregivers) jointly impact cost and process quality outcomes. Cost is measured in terms of total hospital operating expenses per bed while process quality is assessed along two dimensions: conformance quality or the ability to adhere to technical standards and experiential quality or the ability to cater to preferences of the patient. Results suggest complementarities between Clinical and Augmented Clinical HIT with respect to process quality but not cost outcomes. A follow-up post-hoc analysis which divides Augmented Clinical HIT into Electronic Medical Record (EMR) and Non-EMR technologies offers additional explanation to the lack of association with cost. We discuss these implications to both theory and practice of HIT adoption."
Sustainability in multi-tier supply chains: Understanding the double agency role of the first-tier supplier,Miriam M. Wilhelm,18 December 2015,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2015.11.001,"AbstractIn light of the growing complexity of globally dispersed, multi-tier supply chains, the involvement of first-tier suppliers has become instrumental in the quest for achieving sustainability compliance along the supply chain. We describe this new responsibility as the double agency role. We employ agency and institutional theory arguments to explore the conditions under which first-tier suppliers will act as agents who fulfill the lead firm's sustainability requirements (i.e., the primary agency role) and implement these requirements in their suppliers' operations (i.e., the secondary agency role). The findings from three in-depth case studies embedded in different institutional contexts highlight the importance for lead firms to incentivize each agency role separately and to reduce information asymmetries, particularly at the second-tier level. In addition, our inductive analysis reveals several contingency factors that influence the coupling of the secondary agency role of the first-tier supplier. These factors include resource availability at the first-tier supplier's firm, the lead firm's focus on the triple-bottom-line dimension (i.e., environmental or social), the lead firm's use of power, and the lead firm's internal alignment of the sustainability and purchasing function. We integrate our findings in a conceptual framework that advances the research agenda on multi-tier sustainable supply chains, and we subsequently outline the practical implications of assigning the double agency role to first tier suppliers."

Delayering the global production network into congruent subnetworks,Kasra Ferdows,18 December 2015,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2015.11.006,"AbstractThe literature in operations management has not kept up with the growing complexity of and opportunities offered by global production networks. Managers need new tools to cope with this complexity. We propose one that is based on a model that delayers the global plant network into a set of subnetworks on the basis of complexity and proprietary information in the products they produce and production processes they use to produce them. This allows examining whether each subnetwork iscongruent—i.e., has an appropriate manufacturing mission and the competencies that it would need to carry it out. We apply this tool to analyze the global production networks of five companies and illustrate its usefulness in performing periodic audit of the global production network and identifying potential strategic anomalies that deserve attention."
"Point–counterpoint: Resource heterogeneity, performance, and competitive advantage",Mikko Ketokivi,18 December 2015,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2015.10.004,AbstractThis JOM Forum is an exchange of ideas on the antecedents and consequences of resource heterogeneity.

Resource based theory in operations management research,Michael A. Hitt,17 December 2015,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2015.11.002,"AbstractResource based theory (RBT) has become increasingly popular in operations management research. The development and current application of RBT to the study and understanding of operations management problems and phenomena are reviewed and articles in the recent six plus years across nine journals are evaluated. Based on this review and evaluation, we identify several issues in the overall research and highlight some exemplary research themes in the use of RBT in operations management. Our research suggests that further application of RBT can add richness in operations management research, and has the potential to produce multiple contributions for this field and adjacent fields."
Operations management and the resource based view: Another view,Philip Bromiley,23 December 2015,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2015.11.003,"AbstractThis paper evaluates the usefulness of the resource-based view (RBV) to the field of operations management. Based on the seminal RBV articles, we argue that using the RBV does not align with the objectives and activities of operations management researchers in several ways. First, the dependent variable in the RBV is sustained competitive advantage. Using sustained competitive advantage as a dependent variable implies that scholars focus on explaining the differences between the relatively few firms with sustained competitive advantage and all the other firms, ignoring performance variations within the great mass of firms. In addition, competitive advantage exists at the level of the business or the firm and does not directly translate into the normal level of operations management research. Measuring sustained competitive advantage also presents difficulties. Second, the explanatory variables in the RBV are resources that must be rare, valuable and hard or impossible to imitate. Measuring valuable resources or factors firms cannot imitate poses serious problems both in demonstrating value independent of the factor's impact on performance (i.e., avoiding tautology) and in measuring unique or nearly unique entities. Third, under the RBV, prescription is problematic; you cannot prescribe things that firms can readily implement because such things can be imitated. We present the practice-based view (PBV) as a simpler and better alternative for operations management where scholars attempt to explain the entire range of firm and unit performance based on transferable practices."

Improving home care: Knowledge creation through engagement and design,Johan Groop,21 November 2017,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2017.11.001,"AbstractIn this paper, we apply a design science approach to help a Northern European city improve the efficiency of its home care delivery system. Our proposed solution emerges as a synthesis of applying Goldratt's Theory of Constraints and the principles of variable-demand inventory replenishment. The improved system exhibits both more level resource utilization and higher productivity due to more efficient capacity utilization. In addition to improving system efficiency, we gain insights into how authentic operations management problems can be addressed through design research. A crucial aspect of empirically-rooted practical problems is that they always involve multiple stakeholders with only partially overlapping preferences. Consequently, one must not assume or ascribe ana priorisystem objective, instead, it must arise from explicit empirical analysis of the relevant stakeholders. Another characteristic of authentic problems is that they are always embedded in an institutional context that sets significant boundary conditions to the feasibility of solutions. These boundary conditions are an important reminder of the complexity of empirically-rooted managerial problems."
Impact of supply base structural complexity on financial performance: Roles of visible and not-so-visible characteristics,Guanyi Lu,29 October 2017,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2017.10.001,"AbstractSupply chains have become increasingly complex in the last decade, which makes their structural characteristics important determinants of firm performance. Prior studies on supply chain structure have largely emphasizednetwork-levelattributes but ignoredsupply-base levelcharacteristics. However, in many cases it is the 1sttier suppliers, not those “deep in the network,” that have most immediate influence on the buyer. In addition, some structural characteristics, such as direct links between the buyer's suppliers and its customers, are not-so-visible to the buyer, yet can impact its financial performance dramatically. The existing literature has overlooked these not-so-visible structural links. Using objective supply chain data collected fromMergent OnlineandCompustat, we map the supply base structure of 867 public firms. We construct three visible (horizontal, vertical and spatial) and two not-so-visible (eliminative and cooperative) structural complexity metrics, and examine their impacts on buyer firms' financial performance as measured by Return on Assets and Tobin's Q. Our empirical analysis shows that the five dimensions have differential effects: some have negligible impacts while others appear to strongly affect financial performance. Contrary to the common belief that complexity hurts performance, we find that an individual complexity dimension may have both positive and negative effects, and the overall effect may be non-linear."
How much do online consumers really value free product returns? Evidence from eBay,Guangzhi Shang,02 August 2017,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2017.07.001,"AbstractConsumer return rates have been steadily rising in recent years, resulting in growing costs for retailers who must manage the returns process and the disposition of returned products. This cost pressure is driven in part by extremely generous return policies, such as giving consumers a full refund upon return. Interestingly, this common retail practice of full refunds is inconsistent with the recommendations of many analytical models of returns, which nearly always show that a partial refund is optimal. Such inconsistencies between theory and practice might arise when the decision drivers included in the analytical models do not match the decision drivers in practice. It might also be the case that retailers are overly optimistic about the value that consumers assign to a full refund, and thus assume that the value of such a policy outweighs its costs. In this paper, we use data collected from eBay, where identical products are sold with different return policies, to investigate these open questions in the literature. We analyze both the return policy drivers from the retailer's perspective and the return policy value from the consumer's perspective. Our results suggest that the value of a full refund policy to consumers may not be as large as one might expect, and it also exhibits a large heterogeneity across buyers with different levels of online purchase experience. In addition, we provide empirical evidence for what has long been suspected by online retailers – that a non-refundable forward shipping charge quickly erodes any value that consumers assign to return policies. The generality of our results is limited by the fact that eBay differs from traditional retail contexts in many respects, including the fact that eBay buyers may not be representative of the general buyer population. However, our study of how eBay consumers value free returns provides new insights into an understudied area, and it can serve as a starting point for future studies of the value of return policies in other retail contexts."
Attention by design: Using attention checks to detect inattentive respondents and improve data quality,James D. Abbey,05 July 2017,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2017.06.001,"AbstractThis paper examines attention checks and manipulation validations to detect inattentive respondents in primary empirical data collection. These prima facie attention checks range from the simple such as reverse scaling first proposed a century ago to more recent and involved methods such as evaluating response patterns and timed responses via online data capture tools. The attention check validations also range from easily implemented mechanisms such as automatic detection through directed queries to highly intensive investigation of responses by the researcher. The latter has the potential to introduce inadvertent researcher bias as the researcher's judgment may impact the interpretation of the data. The empirical findings of the present work reveal that construct and scale validations show consistently significant improvement in the fit statistics—a finding of great use for researchers working predominantly with scales and constructs for their empirical models. However, based on the rudimentary experimental models employed in the analysis, attention checks generally do not show a consistent, systematic improvement in the significance of test statistics for experimental manipulations. This latter result indicates that, by their very nature, attention checks may trigger an inherent trade-off between loss of sample subjects—lowered power and increased Type II error—and the potential of capitalizing on chance alone—the possibility that the previously significant results were in fact the result of Type I error. The analysis also shows that the attrition rates due to attention checks—upwards of 70% in some observed samples—are far larger than typically assumed. Such loss rates raise the specter that studies not validating attention may inadvertently increase their Type I error rate. The manuscript provides general guidelines for various attention checks, discusses the psychological nuances of the methods, and highlights the delicate balance among incentive alignment, monetary compensation, and the subsequently triggered mood of respondents."
Competitive manufacturing in a high-cost environment: Introduction to the special issue,Suzanne de Treville,28 February 2017,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2017.02.001,
Creating the competitive edge: A new relationship between operations management and industrial policy,Martin Spring,01 February 2017,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2016.12.003,"AbstractPolicy interventions by governments to alter the structure of economic activity have either been dismissed or ignored by operations management (OM) scholars. However, in recent years, such ‘industrial policy’ measures have gained increasing support in developed economies, particularly in relation to manufacturing. This paper argues that contemporary manufacturing in high-cost economies is rooted in technological innovation. As such, it can be enhanced by industrial policy interventions that prevent systems failures in the process of turning technological innovation into commercially viable products. In particular, we argue that this can be achieved by establishing non-firm, intermediate research organizations and by other measures to change the institutional architecture of an economy. We disagree with claims in earlier OM literature that industrial policy is all but irrelevant to manufacturing firms and to OM. Instead, we argue that OM must broaden its conceptual scope so as to encompass active engagement with non-firm network participants such as government-supported intermediate research organizations, and that, as well as learning to be effective users of industrial policy, OM practitioners and academics should engage actively in the development of industrial policy. In this way, high-value, high-productivity manufacturing can be viable in high-cost economic environments."
Why locate manufacturing in a high-cost country? A case study of 35 production location decisions,Mikko Ketokivi,24 January 2017,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2016.12.005,"AbstractIn this paper, we examine in detail 35 final assembly location decisions to gain understanding of the manufacturing location decision from strategy and economic policy perspectives. We are particularly interested in the decision to locate final assembly specifically in a high-cost (high GDP per capita) environment. In contrast with the earlier literature, we focus not just on manufacturing activities themselves, but also the key linkages between production, market, supply chain, and product development. These linkages are examined using three key concepts from theories of organization design: formalization, specificity, and coupling. Using these concepts, an analysis of the micro-structure of each case reveals important commonalities that inform our understanding of location decisions. We conclude by discussing the policy implications of our findings."
The impact of reshoring decisions on shareholder wealth,Emma Brandon-Jones,28 January 2017,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2016.12.002,"AbstractInterest in reshoring, defined as the return of manufacturing and service operations from previously offshored locations to the U.S., has gained momentum recently. Yet, there is no academic evidence on the shareholder value implications of reshoring decisions. This paper analyzes the shareholder wealth effects of 37 reshoring decisions announced by U.S. firms during 2006–2015. Our results indicate that reshoring announcements result in positive abnormal stock returns. Mean (median) abnormal stock returns on reshoring announcements are 0.45% (0.29%), corresponding with a mean (median) market value change of $322.57 million ($31.60 million). Our findings imply that the benefits associated with the reshoring tend to outweigh the costs. This finding is relevant for firms faced with the decision of whether to move business activities from offshore to domestic locations. It is also of interest to policy makers who may seek to further stimulate the reshoring phenomenon."
Why in the world did they reshore? Examining small to medium-sized manufacturer decisions,John V. Gray,01 March 2017,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2017.01.001,"AbstractSmall to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are moving their manufacturing operations from low-cost countries back to high-cost countries, reversing earlier offshoring decisions. These reshoring decisions cannot be completely explained by changing location-related costs. To better understand why SMEs are reshoring, we evaluate nine product-line decisions – six to reshore and three to remain offshore – and codify four empirical observations. We then integrate these observations with relevant literature to develop and analyze a system dynamics model of SMEs' offshoring and reshoring decisions. Synthesizing the above, we articulate propositions regarding SMEs’ reshoring decisions. We conclude by discussing these decisions through the lens of the heuristic decision-making literature, providing managerial and policy implications."
The effect of the Rana Plaza disaster on shareholder wealth of retailers: Implications for sourcing strategies and supply chain governance⋆,Brian W. Jacobs,01 February 2017,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2017.01.002,"AbstractSupply chain and reputational risks are often assumed to motivate firms to source production in developed, high-cost countries rather than developing, low-cost countries.

Do markets reactive negatively enough to such events to motivate firms to shift their sourcing strategy? We analyze the stock market reaction to the Rana Plaza disaster in the Bangladeshi ready-made garment industry to address this question.

Lessons from seru production on manufacturing competitively in a high cost environment,Yong Yin,24 January 2017,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2017.01.003,"AbstractHigh capital and labor costs, coupled with high rates of technological and competitive change, present challenges for manufacturers in developed countries, often spurring them to offshore production to low cost sources. However, the electronics industry provides an exception to this trend, where dynamic, high cost conditions have given rise to a new production system –seru– a cellular assembly approach.Seruevolved as an alternative to lean systems approaches, manifesting important differentiated system design choices that appear to offer promise for manufacturing in dynamic, high-cost markets. This paper reports the results of in-depth, longitudinal case studies of two electronics giants who have implementedseru.The case studies describeseru'sfundamental extensions to, and departures from, lean production, agile production, and group technology-based cellular manufacturing. We explain how Sony and Canon have appliedseruto improve productivity, quality, and flexibility in ways that have enabled them to remain competitive. In addition, our findings elaborate the theory of swift, even flow, with implications for future research of trade-offs related to production efficiency, responsiveness, and competitiveness in high-cost, technologically dynamic markets."
Technical note: Option-based costing and the volatility portfolio,Suzanne de Treville,01 February 2017,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2016.12.004,"AbstractIt has been clearly established that a cost premium for responsiveness may be justified for profitable time-sensitive products, and that this cost premium may suffice to render production in a high-cost environment competitive. Time-insensitive products considered in isolation seldom justify a cost premium, leading many decision makers to conclude that their production does not belong in a high-cost environment. This leads to a manufacturing-location decision in which profitable and time-sensitive products are produced in a high-cost environment and time-insensitive products are transferred to a low-cost environment. Responsiveness, however, requires a capacity buffer that provides the option to meet a demand peak for a profitable, time-sensitive product. Leftover capacity can then be ideally deployed to manufacture time-insensitive products to stock. We propose that the cost of the capacity buffer be considered as an option cost and assigned to the time-sensitive product: “option-based costing”. We then demonstrate use of demand volatility to create a portfolio of products that are time sensitive and insensitive to generate profit and increase competitiveness. Option-based costing combined with a volatility portfolio reveals opportunities to produce competitively in high-cost environments that have typically been considered unfeasible."

Missing link in competitive manufacturing research and practice: Customer-responsive concurrent production,Richard J. Schonberger,25 January 2017,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2016.12.006,"AbstractManufacturing management, in its evolving theory, research, and practice, is plagued by mindsets that are narrowly focused on factory efficiency, with insufficient emphasis on customer responsiveness and its dominant role in competitiveness. In our presentation of these issues we describe and advocate customer-oriented manufacturing practices, in the realm of factory infrastructure. This approach, which we call concurrent production or CP, involves configuring, equipping, and operating factories with a primary focus on synchronization with customer demand. We call on OM researchers to consider these topics in furthering the cause of market competitiveness."
"Addressing the endogeneity dilemma in operations management research: Theoretical, empirical, and pragmatic considerations",Mikko Ketokivi,27 May 2017,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2017.05.001,"AbstractIn this paper, we examine the problem of endogeneity in the context of operations management research. Whereas the extant literature has focused primarily on the statistical aspect of the problem, a comprehensive treatment requires an examination of theoretical and pragmatic considerations as complements. The prevailing problem with the focus on statistical techniques is that the standards tend to be derived from idealizations: the correlation between a regressor and a disturbance term must be exactly zero, or the analysis will be invalid. In actual empirical research settings, such a knife-edge assumption can never be satisfied, indeed it cannot even be directly tested. Idealizations are useful in helping us understand what it would take to eliminate endogeneity, but when applied directly and unconditionally, they lead to unreasonable standards that may unnecessarily stifle substantive inquiry. We believe that it is far more productive and meaningful to ask: “What can we realistically expect empirical scientists to be able to achieve?” To this end, we cover and revisit some of the general technical material on endogeneity, paying special attention to the idiosyncrasies of operations management research and what could constitute reasonable criteria for addressing endogeneity in empirical operations management studies."
Information sharing for sales and operations planning: Contextualized solutions and mechanisms,Riikka Kaipia,29 April 2017,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2017.04.001,"AbstractWe develop actionable design propositions for collaborative sales and operations planning (S&OP) based on the observation of contexts in which benefits are generated — or are absent — from retail information sharing. An information sharing pilot project in a real-life setting of two product manufacturers and one retailer was designed. The project resulted in one manufacturer, serving a retailer from its local factory, developing a process for collaborative S&OP, while the other manufacturer serving a retailer from more distant regional factories abandoned the process. The evaluation of the outcomes experienced by the two manufacturers allows us to examine contexts in fine-grained detail and explain why introducing information sharing in the S&OP processes produce — or fail to produce — benefits. The paper contributes to the supply chain information sharing literature by presenting a field tested and evolved S&OP design for non-standard demand situations, and by a contextual analysis of the mechanisms that produce the benefits of retailer collaboration and information sharing in the S&OP process."
The differing impacts of operational and financial slack on occupational safety in varying market conditions,Frank Wiengarten,20 January 2017,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2016.12.001,"AbstractOperations management scholars have long debated the right level of slack resources required to optimize a production system. Recent research suggests that the right level of operational slack, typically in the form of inventory, is very little but not none. However, this conclusion was reached without considering the role of slack resources in occupational safety, which is a critical oversight since the safety literature predicts that the reduction of operational slack harms workers. To address this gap, secondary data from 3945 publically listed U.S. firms is used to explore the role of operational and financial slack as well as market factors in occupational safety. The results show that decreasing operational slack harms workers and that this effect is mitigated when firms hold higher levels of financial slack. Furthermore, the external market environment also plays a crucial role in the operational slack – safety relationship."
The link between operational leanness and credit ratings,David Bendig,01 December 2016,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2016.11.001,"AbstractAlthough there is rich literature documenting the positive relationship between operational leanness and financial performance, recent research indicates that the effects of leanness may be more complex than is typically assumed. We explore the impact of two kinds of leanness, relative inventory leanness and relative PPE leanness, on credit ratings. We thus use an alternative lens to explore the financial implications of leanness. We analyze secondary U.S. data from 1985 to 2012, with 11,197 firm-year observations of manufacturing firms. Using panel data analysis, we show that inventory leanness is positively associated with credit ratings in a concave relationship. This is consistent with previous research that has looked at the impact of relative inventory leanness on equity performance. Conversely, we find that PPE leanness is negatively related with credit ratings in a concave relationship—in contrast to prior studies addressing the impact of PPE leanness on equity performance."
Risk propagation through payment distortion in supply chains,Alejandro Serrano,01 May 2018,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2018.01.003,"AbstractThe supply chain literature has devoted much attention to studying how the variability of orders propagates upstream. We explore how this insight extends to the variability of payments to suppliers and its impact on how risk is generated and propagates upstream. To do so, we model the financial features of a supply chain based on industry reports and empirical findings from the finance literature. Capturing policies and constraints of the agents in the supply chain in a formal model, we are able to generate and explain the behavior observed in real supply chains. We show that payment variability occurs and propagates, even if orders are constant, in a cash-constrained supply chain. Furthermore, our model reveals that payment variability may even become amplified under severe cash restrictions. We identify the factors that drive the propagation of variability—the industry risk, the firm's operational leverage, the existence of a financial leverage target, and the cost of debt. The model also makes it possible to explore states of nature not often observed in practice, but that may have an effect in managers' behavior, for example, bankruptcies. We numerically illustrate the impact of these drivers on the risk of upper echelons (suppliers and suppliers' suppliers) as well as the interactions between order and payment variability. We close by summarizing our findings and discussing future research opportunities."
Managing responsiveness in the emergency department: Comparing dynamic priority queue with fast track,Yann B. Ferrand,17 June 2018,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2018.03.001,"AbstractEmergency Departments (EDs) commonly face capacity imbalances and long wait times in a service system handling patients with different priorities. These problems are particularly important for low-priority patients who often remain in the queue for extended periods. We investigate two distinct approaches to address these challenges: fast track (FT) and dynamic priority queue (DPQ). Traditionally, EDs have prioritized patients using an Emergency Severity Index (ESI), in conjunction with FT, to strictly or partially dedicate resources to different ESI patient classes. With our proposed DPQ, patients are prioritized using ESI and additional real-time operational information about the patient, specifically the amount of accumulated wait time and flow time. Using an empirical simulation, we compare the impact of different resource allocation and prioritization approaches on patient length of stay (LOS), including the existing system at the ED, FT with strict and partial dedication and the possibility of shorter and less variable service times, and versions of the proposed DPQ using simple dynamic prioritization. Our main results are that: (i) the DPQ approach dominates the other approaches tested; (ii) for various ED sizes, FT with strict and partial dedication do not reduce average LOS of low-priority patients without significantly increasing average LOS of high-priority patients, unless service time mean and variance are reduced; (iii) DPQ using accumulated wait time or accumulated flow time improves performance. The results are robust to changes in the proportion of patients in each priority level. Overall, expanding decision making about patient prioritization from only considering the patient's clinical condition to also including operational data can improve performance dramatically, even without improved service times."
Toward a theory of supply chain fields – understanding the institutional process of supply chain localization,Zhaohui Wu,06 April 2018,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2018.03.002,"AbstractWhen western multinational enterprises (MNEs) build end-to-end supply chains (SCs) to produce and distribute a product or deliver a service in emerging economies, the process is called supply chain localization. These companies encounter institutional environments with regulative, normative and cognitive characteristics very different from those in their home countries. SC localization uncovers and creates institutional voids; we argue that SC localization is a process of institutional change, requiring the MNE to build new institutional infrastructure. To the best of our knowledge, little is known about the institutional process of SC localization and its effects. We carry out a longitudinal case study to investigate SC localization of four MNEs in China. These MNEs are leaders of sustainable business practices in their industries, a distinction that highlights institutional voids in their SC settings. Based on the idea of fields in institutional theory, we build a mid-range theory by introducing the notion of thesupply chain field.Our study identifies and contextualizes the key elements of an SC field. It recognizes MNEs, government and semi-government entities, and other participants as institutional actors who serve as architects and builders of the new SCs. We find that SC localization is an institutional process, taking place at both actor and field levels, where continuous ideation of new operations practices leads to structuring of the both the SC and SC field."
Developing country sub-supplier responses to social sustainability requirements of intermediaries: Exploring the influence of framing on fairness perceptions and reciprocity,Vivek Soundararajan,30 April 2018,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2018.04.001,"AbstractResearch on social sustainability in multi-tier supply chains is limited. Specifically, we know very little about a) the micro-processes involved in the way in which sub-suppliers (i.e., first-tier suppliers or sourcing agents) respond to the sustainability requirements imposed by their intermediaries; and b) the micro-level antecedents that condition their responses. To address these gaps, we used a longitudinal multiple case study method to explore multiple intermediary – sub-supplier dyads in South India's knitwear garment industry and drew upon constructs of behavioural economics. We found that the way in which intermediaries frame social sustainability requirements and their associated procedures influence both the way in which sub-suppliers perceive the procedural fairness of those requirements and the way in which they thus reciprocate. When intermediaries frame social sustainability requirements as ‘opportunity’ and engage in various procedures perceived to be procedurally fair by sub-suppliers, the latter reciprocate positively. Contrastingly, when intermediaries frame social sustainability requirements as ‘insulation’ and engage in various procedures perceived to be procedurally unfair by sub-suppliers, the latter reciprocate negatively. Under the production-dominant framing, sub-suppliers exhibit positive reciprocity only related to processing production orders. Our analysis inductively generated propositions that emphasize the important role played by framing in shaping the perceptions of fairness held by sub-suppliers towards social sustainability requirements and the reciprocity of the latter's responses to them."
"Product competition, managerial discretion, and manufacturing recalls in the U.S. pharmaceutical industry",George P. Ball,30 May 2018,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2018.04.003,"AbstractEmpirical research examining whether and how competition influences product recalls is limited. We address this important research gap by creating a novel measure of product competition using data from the Food and Drug Administration's Orange Book, and combining it with product recall data across a 12-year period. Our results show that product competition is positively associated with manufacturing-related recalls, providing evidence of a possible downside to competition in the pharmaceutical industry. Although competition is fostered by numerous federal regulations, we find that it may encourage companies to relax quality standards during the manufacturing process, which may result in lower quality products. We also find that this relationship is contingent on managerial discretion surrounding the recall decision. While product competition is associated with anincreasein high severity, low discretion recalls, it is associated with adecreasein low severity, high discretion recalls. Findings from this study have critical implications for policy-makers who regulate product competition in the pharmaceutical industry."
Performance implications of the fit between suppliers' flexibility and their customers' expected flexibility: A dyadic examination⋆,David Gligor,24 May 2018,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2018.05.002,"AbstractAlthough an increase in flexibility for firms usually entails further investments and higher operating overhead for their suppliers (Sheikhzadeh et al., 1998Koste and Malhotra, 1999), most studies have focused exclusively on the benefits derived from additional flexibility enjoyed by the buyer firms neglecting the impact on the financial performance of their suppliers (e.g., Malhotra and Mackelprang, 2012; Gligor, 2014; Mandal, 2015). To explore the complex supplier-customer interplay, we introduce the concept ofbuyer-supplier flexibility fit(i.e., the match between the level of flexibility the customer expects from its supplier and the supplier's level of flexibility) and explore its impact on the supplier's financial performance (i.e., ROA). We collected dyadic archival and survey data from 638 firms (319 supplier-customer dyads) to test these relationships. Our results indicate that buyer-supplier flexibility fit has a direct and positive impact on the supplier's ROA. Further, the strength of the relationship increases when firms operate in munificent and/or dynamic environments but does not change significantly in complex environments. The relationship also becomes stronger as the exchanged business volume increases between the customer and its supplier, and as the relationship progresses in age. In addition, our findings indicate that firms with perfect buyer-supplier flexibility fit perform best, followed by firms with negative misfit (i.e., the supplier's level of flexibility is lower than its customer's expected level of flexibility), while firms with positive misfit (i.e., the supplier's level of flexibility is higher than its customer's expected level of flexibility) are the laggards. Interestingly, positive misfit has a stronger negative impact on suppliers' ROA compared to misfit in general and negative misfit. Key corresponding managerial implications are derived."

Supplier dependence and R&D intensity: The moderating role of network centrality and interconnectedness,Dong-Young Kim,17 December 2018,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2018.11.002,"AbstractThis study examines whether financial dependence upon a few customers is negatively related to the allocation of innovation resources of supplier firms. Furthermore, this study investigates whether these negative effects of supplier dependence on research and development (R&D) intensity are reduced when the supplier leverages social capital conceptualized in terms of eigenvector centrality and interconnectedness. Using panel data, we find that a supplier firm's dependence upon major customers has a negative relationship with the supplier firm's R&D intensity. Our results, however, reveal that a dependent supplier having high eigenvector centrality or working with other companies that are densely connected to each other mitigates the negative effects of supplier dependence on R&D intensity. These findings highlight the importance of external information or resources being available in supply networks when suppliers that are dependent upon major customers explore and exploit opportunities for new product development."
On doing relevant and rigorous experiments: Review and recommendations,Sirio Lonati,17 December 2018,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2018.10.003,"AbstractAlthough experiments are the gold standard for establishing causality, several threats can undermine the internal validity of experimental findings. In this article, we first discuss these threats, which include the lack of consequential decisions and outcomes, deception, demand effects and unfair comparisons, as well as issues concerning statistical validity (e.g., minimum sample size per cell, estimating variance correctly). We expose each problem, show potential solutions, and bring to the fore issues of relevance of the findings (i.e., external and ecological validity). Thereafter, we take stock of the state-of-the-science regarding validity threats using a representative sample of 468 recent experiments from 258 articles published in top-tier journals. We compare research practices in three fields of study—management, social psychology, and economics, which regularly use experimental research—to operations management, which has more recently begun to use the experimental paradigm. Our results underscore the importance for journals and authors to follow what we identify to be best-practice methodological suggestions (i.e., the “ten commandments” of experimental research). We show that—on average—markers of methodological rigor and generalizability positively and significantly predict the citations received by published articles. Finally, given that experiments are infeasible in some settings, we conclude with a brief review of often overlooked quasi-experimental designs, which are useful for generating strong counterfactuals and hence allow making causal claims in the field."
Hedging weather risk and coordinating supply chains,Xavier Brusset,17 December 2018,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2018.10.002,"AbstractThe sales of many products can be influenced by weather conditions, positively or negatively. For the manufacturers in question, one of their entrepreneurial risks is to incur lower than expected sales because of adverse weather conditions. The variability of weather conditions is expected to continue to rise because of climate change. Manufacturers can choose to do nothing and suffer the financial consequences, or transfer the weather risk partly or wholly to others. This paper presents an approach to transfer weather risks to risk takers and reduce sales volatility using weather index-based financial instruments. In our approach, the risk of adverse weather conditions is calculated on the basis of adverse conditions observed in the past. We do not use forecasts of weather conditions. We illustrate our action design with case studies of three companies: a company manufacturing automotive replacement parts, a clothing company and a company producing of sunscreen products. We demonstrate its efficiency in reducing cash-flow uncertainty and potential losses caused by adverse weather, and in influencing sales to the next tier.Highlights•Unseasonal weather affects sales in 70% of economic sectors.•Sales are not only affected at retail level but up the supply chain too.•Our methodology helps manufacturers evaluate weather risk.•We present three examples of how to hedge against weather risk.•We show how such hedging policy can reduce sales variance."
"Addressing endogeneity in operations management research: Recent developments, common problems, and directions for future research",Guanyi Lu,26 October 2018,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2018.10.001,"AbstractAddressing endogeneity can be a challenging task given the different sources of endogeneity and their impacts on empirical results. While premier business journals typically expect authors to rigorously address endogeneity, this expectation is relatively new to many Operations Management (OM) scholars, as exemplified by a recent editorial inJournal of Operations Managementthat calls for more rigorous treatment for endogeneity. This study serves two purposes. First, we summarize recent OM literature with respect to the treatment for endogeneity by reviewing studies published in leading OM journals between 2012 and 2017. The review provides evidence that endogeneity problems have received increasing attention from OM scholars. However, we also find some common problems that may render the chosen techniques for addressing endogeneity less effective and potentially lead to biased analysis results. Second, since instrumental variable regression is the most prevalent technique for dealing with endogeneity in the OM literature according to our review, we provide an empirical illustration tailored to OM researchers for using instrumental variable regression in the post-design (data analysis) phase. Using variables from a publicly available healthcare dataset, our analysis sheds light on the importance of examining instruments' quality and triangulating results based on more than one test/estimator."
On the riskiness of lower-tier suppliers: Managing sustainability in supply networks,Verónica H. Villena,08 October 2018,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2018.09.004,"AbstractAlthough multinational companies (MNCs) have increasingly embraced a sustainability strategy for their own operations, fewer have tried to engage their (tier-one) suppliers in their sustainability initiatives. It is even rarer that MNCs engage their suppliers' suppliers (lower-tier suppliers), despite the latter having a higher incidence of violations with more acute environmental and social impacts that can jeopardize the MNCs’ operations and reputation. We conducted inductive research on three supply networks in the automotive, electronics, and consumer product/pharmaceutical industries. We collected data on three leading sustainable MNCs and a subset of 9 tier-one suppliers and 22 lower-tier suppliers and complemented that information with data on several NGOs and industry organizations. This study (1) reveals that many lower-tier suppliers address their environmental and labor issuespassivelyand constitute the riskiest suppliers in a supply network; (2) provides a grounded theoretical framework for managing a sustainable supply network that accounts for multiple network members as well as three sustainability dimensions (the 3Ps: profit, people, and planet); and (3) shows how processes MNCs use to manage their suppliers differ from processes these suppliers use with their own (lower-tier) suppliers. The study reveals the practices that leading sustainable MNCs use to manage their supply networks and provides important future research directions."
Avoiding epistemological silos and empirical elephants in OM: How to combine empirical and simulation methods?,Aravind Chandrasekaran,06 December 2018,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2018.11.003,"AbstractProgression of knowledge in operations management (OM) relies on researchers building and testing theories using data from practice. However, standalone empirical research designs have inherent limitations and may not adequately capture complex OM problems. This may result in researchers narrowing the scope of the problems that they create epistemological silos and study empirical elephants. In this introductory article to the special issue, we look at the ways simulation methods can augment and answer questions that are not addressed through traditional empirical methods. We offer a framework regarding how and when to use simulation methods for a given research objectives and design. We conclude by discussing the contingencies of using these methods as well as the role of reviewers and editors in evaluating papers that involve such methods."
Inventory record inaccuracy dynamics and the role of employees within multi-channel distribution center inventory systems,Mark Barratt,26 October 2018,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2018.09.003,"AbstractThe dynamics of inventory record inaccuracy (IRI) remain under-explored in a multi-channel distribution center (MCDC) setting. Additionally, how employees interact with the rest of an MCDC's inventory system to impact IRI is yet to be explored. To address these issues, our research adopts a multi-method exploratory approach to understand the nature and existence of IRI between cycle counts in a multi-channel environment based on continuous, daily IRI-related observations. These data are then used to develop a system dynamics model to further explore the interaction between employees and the rest of the inventory system. Our case study finds substantial levels of IRI on a daily basis, with varying levels of consistency and a bias toward negative errors, raising concerns as to the suitability and stability of MCDC inventory systems. We also find varying IRI effects depending on the channel, with inventory density, in particular, having mixed influences. Further, we provide evidence for substantial volatilities of daily IRI likely generated by employee-system interactions in the MCDC. Without the daily perspective, such evidence would otherwise have remained unobserved. Our system dynamics model also provides a novel framework to show how employees interact with MCDC inventory characteristics to affect the dynamic level and stability of IRI. This research also provides suggestions for managing and further examining these phenomena."
Multinational enterprise buyers’ choices for extending corporate social responsibility practices to suppliers in emerging countries: A multi-method study,Xun Tong,24 May 2018,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2018.05.003,"AbstractWhen managing a global supply chain, one critical challenge encountered by multinational enterprises (MNEs) is the extension of corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices to suppliers in emerging countries. In this study, we use a multi-method approach to explore 1) the nature of suppliers’ CSR heterogeneity based on the various components of CSR in emerging countries, and 2) the choices of MNEs for extending CSR to different types of suppliers in dynamic environments. We begin with a survey of Chinese original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) servicing MNEs to examine how these suppliers vary in CSR implementation based on cluster analysis results. To understand the choices made by MNE buyers for extending CSR to their OEM suppliers, we conduct an agent-based simulation study considering the dynamics of a system with multiple agents (i.e., MNE buyers, OEM suppliers, and the government). The cluster analysis results show that CSR practices implemented by Chinese OEMs differ significantly from one another and can be classified into three clusters (i.e.,Leader,Follower,andLaggard). The simulation results provide insights into how the adaption costs (e.g., upgrade cost and cost saved by downgrading) and punitive (inspection with possible penalties) and supportive (subsidies) tactics adopted by the government affect the choices made by MNE buyers for extending CSR practices to suppliers in emerging countries. Moreover, we demonstrate when supportive tactics are more effective than punitive tactics under varying conditions and extend the model to investigate the consequences of switching between these two types of tactics in a sequential simulation."
Asset supply networks in humanitarian operations: A combined empirical-simulation approach,Jon M. Stauffer,09 August 2018,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2018.07.002,"AbstractInternational humanitarian organizations (IHOs) respond to mega disasters while maintaining development programs in the rest of the world (ROW). This means an IHO's asset supply network must perform the challenging task of supporting a fast disaster response while simultaneously maintaining cost-effective ROW development programs. We study how supply network asset flows are impacted during a mega disaster response and find that resource fluidity, the capability to reallocate resources quickly, impacts both mega disaster and ROW program asset flows within these supply networks. Using data from a large IHO's response to a mega disaster and econometric models, we find a dependency between ROW asset flow and mega disaster asset flow in IHOs with resource fluidity. As mega disaster flow increases, there is a decrease in hub-to-hub ROW asset flows and an increase in other ROW asset flows. This is contrary to most humanitarian operations research, which typically assumes independent asset flows. Because of resource fluidity, the combination of these flows does not compromise ROW operations. We use these empirical results to feed a simulation analysis that extends our research to IHOs without resource fluidity and provides actionable insights for varying types of IHOs in various demand scenarios. Simulation insights illustrate that resource fluidity impacts IHO asset supply network costs and optimal configurations."
Worth the wait? How restaurant waiting time influences customer behavior and revenue,Jelle De Vries,21 May 2018,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2018.05.001,"AbstractIn many service industries, customers have to wait for service. When customers have a choice, this waiting may influence their service experience, sojourn time, and ultimately spending, reneging, and return behavior. Not much is known however, about the system-wide impact of waiting on customer behavior and resulting revenue. In this paper, we empirically investigate this by analyzing data obtained from 94,404 customers visiting a popular Indian restaurant during a 12 month period. The results show that a longer waiting time relates to reneging behavior, a longer time until a customer returns, and a shorter dining duration. To find out the impact of the consequences of waiting time, we use the empirical findings and data collected in a simulation experiment. This experiment shows that, without waiting, the total revenue generated by the restaurant would increase by nearly 15% compared to the current situation. Stimulating customers to reserve could enable restaurants to reap part of this benefit. Furthermore, the results of simulation experiments suggest that, within the boundaries of the current capacity, revenue could be increased by a maximum of 7.5% if more flexible rules were used to allocate customers to tables. Alternatively, by increasing the existing seating capacity by 20%, revenue could be boosted by 7.7% without the need to attract additional customers. Our findings extend the knowledge on the consequences of customer waiting, and enable service providers to better understand the financial and operational impact of waiting-related decisions in service settings."
Structural anatomy and evolution of supply chain alliance networks: A multi-method approach,Hyunwoo Park,28 September 2018,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2018.09.001,"AbstractWe investigate the evolution of supply chain alliance networks with a focus on the influence of structural, firm-, and industry-level mechanisms. While several structural supply chain characteristics have been found to be significant drivers of firm innovation and performance, a dearth of studies exists examining how these characteristics change over time by influencing one another. We develop and empirically test hypotheses on the impact of prior structural configurations and the moderating roles of absorptive capacity and industry growth on the temporal trajectory of supply chain alliance network structures. Adopting a multi-method approach, we jointly use econometric analyses and simulation experiments to examine our hypotheses from complementary angles. Specifically, we characterize the dynamic relationship between the structural mechanisms on a longitudinal dataset of 2221 unique firms and 13,668 firm-year observations spanning 25 years. We find empirical support for negative crossover effects between two key structural properties of supply chain alliance networks, a positive moderation of a firm's absorptive capacity, and a negative moderation of industry growth on the structural reinforcement. We conduct corresponding simulation experiments based on a separable temporal exponential random graph model (STERGM) to track the temporal changes in the simulated networks' key measures. The simulation results concur with most of our empirical findings and provide additional insights complementary to our econometric analysis results. By focusing on the mechanism of temporal changes in network structural properties, our study contributes to supply chain management research with a supply network perspective and interfirm alliance network research by broadening its scope into structural dynamism. Our multi-method approach demonstrates how multiple complementary methodologies can foster a more nuanced understanding of managing supply chain alliance network management."
The decision to recall: A behavioral investigation in the medical device industry,George P. Ball,07 August 2018,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2018.07.003,"AbstractThe decision to recall a product can significantly affect an operations manager's career, the credibility and financial performance of the firm, and the safety of customers. Despite the importance of this decision, there has been little behavioral research on what influences judgment in this task. Leveraging insights from interviews with regulators and professionals in the medical device industry, and supported by behavioral theory, we identify a set of factors that may influence the recall decision. We test the effect of these factors using a primary experiment with 167 managers from a Fortune 500 medical device firm and a replication study with 614 subjects from Amazon Mechanical Turk. We find that a physician's ability to detect a defect prior to product use decreases the likelihood to recall, while a manager's understanding of the root cause of the defect increases the likelihood to recall. In a second study with 372 Amazon Mechanical Turk subjects, we find that perceived patient customer harm and perceived cost of the recall both mediate the relationship between defect detectability and recall likelihood, but that harm is more influential than cost. Further, the perceived cost of the recall also mediates the relationship between root cause understanding and recall likelihood. By uncovering behavioral factors and their mechanisms in the recall decision, this study offers important insights to both industry and regulators."
Inventory agility upon demand shocks: Empirical evidence from the financial crisis,Maximiliano Udenio,04 October 2018,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2018.08.001,"AbstractThe objective of this paper is to identify antecedents of inventory agility (i.e., the capability to quickly adapt inventories to changes in demand) upon demand shocks based on the awareness-motivation-capability (AMC) framework and to explore the link between inventory agility and financial performance. We introduce an empirical measure of inventory agility based on the deviation of relative inventories (i.e., inventory days) from their forecasted values. We hypothesize that firms with higher awareness, motivation, and capabilities are associated with higher inventory agility in the presence of demand shocks. We define two empirical measures for each of the three dimensions of the AMC framework in the context of inventory agility: awareness (i.e., market orientation and technology orientation), motivation (i.e., gross margin and liquidity), and capabilities (i.e., inventory management capability and resource availability). In addition, we incorporate the constraining factor model (CFM) into the AMC framework, thus allowing for complementarity among the different measures. In this view, the influence of each of the measures on inventory agility varies according to which of the measures is the constraining factor for a given firm. The 2008 financial crisis may have tested firms' inventory agility more than any other crisis since the Great Depression, as an unprecedented collapse of demand coincided with a reduction in credit availability. Therefore, for our analysis, we use firm-level empirical data from 1263 public U.S. manufacturing firms for the 2005–2011 period. We find that firms' motivation and capabilities are key factors associated with inventory agility. Through the CFM, we show that identifying the constraining factors leads to a more refined understanding of the moderating effects of the antecedents of inventory agility. In a separate analysis, we find that inventory agility is positively associated with a number of financial performance metrics during crisis periods. We distinguish between inventory underages and overages and find that, during the crisis, they are both associated with lower financial performance. Furthermore, we find evidence that higher underages (overages) magnify the effect of overages (underages). Among other managerial insights, our findings suggest that the use of inventory reductions as a quick way to increase liquidity must be gauged against their potential impact on other aspects of financial performance."
Purchasing managers' willingness to pay for attributes that constitute sustainability,Philipp Goebel,08 September 2018,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2018.08.002,"AbstractConsidering the increasing international division of labor, as well as stakeholders' growing awareness of sustainability, assuring that business practices are sustainable is a major challenge. Companies have to account for the fact that any misconduct at a supplier's premises may have spillover effects that reach the manufacturer or retailer. Therefore, purchasing managers have to assure that their suppliers are compliant with sustainability standards. This, however, may induce higher purchasing costs and, as a consequence, force a trade-off between (short term) economic (i.e., purchasing cost reduction) and social/environmental sustainability criteria. How purchasing managers evaluate this trade-off is particularly interesting because they often receive performance-based salaries that incentivize the reduction of purchasing costs. Our paper sheds light on this trade-off by examining how much purchasing managers are willing to pay to assure compliance along different sustainability dimensions when selecting new suppliers in a mature market setting, namely Germany. Additionally, we identify potential (individual, professional, and organization-related) factors that may impact the purchasing managers' willingness to pay (WTP), and examine their effects. Among the most surprising findings, purchasing managers on average are willing to pay a price premium for manuals that demonstrate compliance with the United Nationals Global Compact (UNGC). Furthermore, the results show that this WTP is mostly influenced (negatively) by self-enhancement (on the individual level) and/or obedience to authority (on the organizational level), but the effects of company, affiliation with the UNGC, gender, or years of experience have no influence. Moreover, the WTP is higher for the social than for the environmental dimension, and the marginal effect of accreditation on WTP depends on which combinations of dimensions are accredited."
Effectiveness of bonus and penalty incentive contracts in supply chain exchanges: Does national culture matter?,Yun Shin Lee,24 October 2018,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2018.09.002,"AbstractIn this study, we investigate the impact of national culture on the effectiveness of bonus and penalty incentive contracts in supply chain exchanges. We conducted laboratory experiments in Canada, China, and South Korea, involving transactional exchanges in which suppliers were presented with either bonus or penalty contracts. Then we compared suppliers’ contract acceptance, level of effort, and shirking across national cultures. Our findings reveal critical cultural influences on contract effectiveness. We show that although acceptance of bonus contracts is comparable across cultures, suppliers from Canada, a national culture considered low in power distance and high in humane orientation, exhibit lower acceptance rates of penalty contracts. In addition, we find evidence that suppliers associated with collectivist cultures exert more effort and shirk less in bonus contracts but these relationships also are more complex. When we compare contract effectiveness across bonus and penalty contracts within a given cultural setting, we find in all three countries greater acceptance of bonus contracts than penalty contracts. Also, after contracts are accepted, bonus contracts are more successful in China because suppliers exert greater effort and shirk less under bonus contracts than penalty contracts. However, in Canada and South Korea, the results of accepted contracts for both penalty and bonus contracts are nearly indistinguishable."
Supplier non-retention post disruption: What role does anger play?,Mikaella Polyviou,17 July 2018,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2018.07.001,"AbstractWe analyze the direct and indirect effects of two critical-component supply-disruption attributes (CONTROLLABILITYandRESPONSIBILITY) on supplier non-retention post disruption. Using a scenario-based role-playing experiment with 253 purchasing professionals, we find that the likelihood that a recovery lead (i.e., the individual assigned to the disruption-recovery task) recommends non-retention of an incumbent critical-component supplier post disruption is higher when the recovery lead perceives that the supplier, rather than nature, had control over the supply disruption. Moreover, this direct effect is partially explained by the amount ofANGERthat the recovery lead feels due to the supply disruption. Neither the direct nor the indirect effect ofRESPONSIBILITYon supplier non-retention post disruption is, however, detected. This paper is among the first to offer theoretical and empirical evidence that supplier non-retention in a supply-disruption context is a function of who had control over the supply disruption. Furthermore, this paper considers the effects of emotions and illustrates that supply-management decisions are not based solely on rational (i.e., cognitive) processes but also on emotional processes. Finally, this paper challenges conceptual arguments about the association between supplier selection and retention, at least in the supply-disruption context and with regard to the individual participating in both tasks. Our findings also have several managerial implications for supplying and buying firms."
Assessing impacts of introducing ship-to-store service on sales and returns in omnichannel retailing: A data analytics study,M. Serkan Akturk,09 July 2018,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2018.06.004,"AbstractOmnichannel retailing features, such as ship-to-store (STS) service, are designed to deliver a seamless shopping experience for customers. For a retailer, introducing omnichannel capabilities requires major investments to integrate physical stores and online marketplaces, yet holds a promise of potentially enhancing revenue streams from both brick-and-mortar (BM) stores and online store channels. We assess the promise of ship-to-store capabilities by analyzing transactional data from a national jewelry retailer to study impacts of introducing ship-to-store on a retailer's operating performance, in terms of sales and customer returns. Contrary to expectations, the findings show that online sales decreased after ship-to-store was introduced, although BM store sales increased. Detailed analysis of the transactional data suggests that, after STS implementation, some customers switched from the online channel to the brick-and-mortar channel. This switch occurred mainly for high-value purchases. The customers who actually remained with and fully completed a sale using the ship-to-store service typically were those that bought low-value items. Our findings also suggest that introducing ship-to-store increased cross-channel customer returns of online purchases to physical stores. Concurrently, these new ship-to-store returns generated additional BM store sales. The paper contributes by showing how introducing ship-to-store service can have different impacts in terms of sales and returns across a retailer's channels."
Valuing supply-chain responsiveness under demand jumps,Işık Biçer,02 August 2018,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2018.06.002,"AbstractAs the time between the decision about what to produce and the moment when demand is observed (thedecision lead time) increases, the demand forecast becomes more uncertain. Uncertainty can increase gradually in decision lead time, or can increase as a dramatic change in median demand. Whether the forecast evolves gradually or injumpshas important implications for the value of responsiveness, which we model as the cost premium worth paying to reduce the decision lead time (thejustified cost premium). Demand uncertainty arising from jumps rather than from constant volatility increases the justified cost premium when an average jump increases median demand, but decreases the justified cost premium when an average jump decreases median demand. We fit our model to two data sets, first publicly available demand data from Reebok, then point-of-sale data from a supermarket chain. Finally, we present two special cases of the model, one covering a sudden loss of demand, and the other a one-time adjustment to median demand."
"An empirical examination of surgeon experience, surgeon rating, and costs in perioperative services",Sriram Venkataraman,10 July 2018,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2018.04.002,"AbstractWe examine how physicians affect the flow of patients through Perioperative Services (POS) on the day of surgery by studying the effects of surgeon experience and surgeon quality (measured by Healthgrades rating) on patients' flow. We control for the work environment created by the POS manager's resource allocation decision, which determines the utilization levels of the three POS departments: Pre-operative (PreOp), Operating Room (OR), and Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU). Using patient level data from a large teaching hospital, we find that POS managers in all three departments view overtime costs as more important than idle time costs, which implies that they keep capacity slack available for patient care in each department. Further, our findings suggest that highly experienced surgeons take ownership of their patients' experience in the POS and that their patients spend less time in PreOp and the OR. We argue that not only do more experienced surgeons perform surgical procedures more efficiently, but they also coordinate better with PreOp to reduce patient waiting time there. We find that a surgeon's rating has no direct effect on a patient's actual surgery time in the OR, but that the effect of surgeon experience on actual surgery time is higher, in magnitude, for a lower-rated surgeon than for a higher-rated surgeon. Finally, we conduct a counterfactual analysis and find that highly experienced surgeons reduce the total length of a patient's stay in the POS."
Does the meaningful use of electronic health records improve patient outcomes?,Deepa Wani,22 June 2018,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2018.06.003,"AbstractWhile Electronic Health Records (EHRs) hold the promise of improving patient outcomes, past research on their efficacy has yielded inconsistent results. In this study, we overcome several drawbacks of past research by examining not just partial versus full adoption, but the impact of meaningful assimilation of EHRs as mandated by the HITECH (Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health) Act. Detailed patient-level data from acute-care hospitals in California, coupled with relevant data from several other sources, is used to conduct our analysis. After controlling for self-selection bias, our results show that overall length of stay (LOS) is reduced by 3%, on average, for all patients who undergo treatment at hospitals that are meaningful-use assimilated, relative to patients at hospitals that have fully adopted EHRs. The magnitude of this reduction is increased for patients with greater comorbidity complexity and greater coordination complexity. In addition, we find an overall decrease in readmission. We do not find such benefits among full adopters of EHRs. Thus, our study provides empirical evidence that instead of merely adoption, assimilation of EHRs at a hospital-wide level can improve the efficiency with which patients are treated, with benefits from such an assimilation being far more pronounced for patients with a greater degree of health complexities. These are important findings, because hospitals are struggling to deliver quality care to their sickest patients without severe cost overruns. Recommendations from our study point to a path forward in meeting this challenge."
Designing crowdsourced delivery systems: The effect of driver disclosure and ethnic similarity,Ha Ta,22 June 2018,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2018.06.001,"AbstractCrowdsourced delivery is a service operations model that has proliferated in recent years, bringing unique opportunities and challenges to online retail operations. In particular, new technology enabled features, such as the disclosure of delivery drivers' identities, introduce a social dimension prior to delivery service encounters that might influence customers' service quality expectations and ultimately impact their attitudes towards the retailers. Building on premises of social identity theory, this research investigates effects of various crowdsourced delivery system designs related to driver disclosure and ethnicity on customers' attitudes towards the drivers and retailers. Using data from a scenario-based experiment with 761 participants across two studies, we find that crowdsourced delivery designs that disclose drivers' identity increase customers' trust, satisfaction, and repurchase intentions only when customers perceive the drivers to be similar to them, particularly with regard to ethnicity. The designs that offer driver choice options are also found to be highly regarded by customers. In addition, the similarity effects of crowdsourced delivery designs differ depending on certain customer characteristics. Overall, our research shows crowdsourced delivery - as a technology-driven phenomenon - may portend unexpected and challenging social dilemmas for operations managers. Our findings contribute to emerging research on the intersection of service design, technology management, and the sharing economy."
Judgmental selection of forecasting models,Fotios Petropoulos,18 June 2018,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2018.05.005,"AbstractIn this paper, we explored how judgment can be used to improve the selection of a forecasting model. We compared the performance of judgmental model selection against a standard algorithm based on information criteria. We also examined the efficacy of a judgmental model-build approach, in which experts were asked to decide on the existence of the structural components (trend and seasonality) of the time series instead of directly selecting a model from a choice set. Our behavioral study used data from almost 700 participants, including forecasting practitioners. The results from our experiment suggest that selecting models judgmentally results in performance that is on par, if not better, to that of algorithmic selection. Further, judgmental model selection helps to avoid the worst models more frequently compared to algorithmic selection. Finally, a simple combination of the statistical and judgmental selections and judgmental aggregation significantly outperform both statistical and judgmental selections."
Assessing the exchange of knowledge between operations management and other fields: Some challenges and opportunities,Jack R. Meredith,18 June 2018,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2018.05.004,"AbstractAddressing a suspicion that the field of Operations Management (OM) draws substantially more knowledge from non-OM journals than those journals draw from OM journals in return, we studied the citations of the top 30 research journals of interest to our field. We conducted citation analyses of the three oldest OM journals over three decades in comparison to the 27 other journals representing the fields of Management, Operations Research/Management Science (OR/MS), Marketing, Practice, and Engineering. We examined both the entire 30-year period and then each decade separately. Our suspicions were confirmed—although citations from these 27 journals to these three OM journals have increased by a factor of 7 over the three decades, we in OM still cite these journals about twenty-five times more often than they cite our journals, giving an indication of the knowledge development and flows among these fields. We then describe some challenges for the field of OM in providing more research knowledge to other fields but also some opportunities that OM should be able to capitalize on, such as our historic ties to practice and our escalating research in strategic and organizational issues."
Socially responsible supply chains in emerging markets: Some research opportunities,Christopher S.

The impact of physician-hospital integration on hospital supply management,Yousef Abdulsalam,23 March 2018,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2018.01.001,"AbstractThis study examines how organizational alignment between professionals—who act as surrogate buyers-- and the organizations in which they work, influence the supply management efficiency of the organization. Based on a cross-sectional sample of hospital data, we estimate random effects regression models to investigate the association between physician-hospital integration mechanisms and hospital supply efficiency. The results suggest that either professional hierarchy or bureaucratic pressures can improve supply management efficiency. In a sector of the economy characterized by escalating costs and uncertainty, the findings provide potential guidance for professional relationship strategy design to improve sector performance."
Impact of competition on process of care and resource investments,Deepa Wani,20 January 2018,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2017.12.002,"AbstractAlthough competition is generally believed to improve quality, its impact on the Process of Care (PoC)—which measures the timeliness and effectiveness of care—is less clear. Moreover, hospital executives in more competitive hospital markets are faced with several competing priorities. Our study seeks to examine two factors within this context: (1) how competition directly impacts PoC, and (2) in a financially constrained environment, how competition affects investments in resources such as nurses and technology that can potentially improve PoC. We collect longitudinal data from all acute care hospitals in California over a 7-year period from 2007 to 2013, along with data from several other sources. Analysis using a mixed-methods approach reveals that both PoC and investments in nurses and technology are lower in more competitive markets. Because future reimbursements under the pay-for-performance system will depend on the value of care provided, our results suggest that hospitals should reconsider their short-term actions that seek to increase market share and instead adopt a long-term view in which investments are made to fundamentally improve the underlying processes and PoC. The findings presented here thus have major implications for managing hospitals in competitive environments."
Incentivizing supplier participation in buyer innovation: Experimental evidence of non-optimal contractual behaviors,Tingting Yan,16 February 2018,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2017.12.001,"AbstractOriginal equipment manufacturers increasingly involve suppliers in new product development (NPD) projects. How companies design a contract to motivate supplier participation is an important but under-examined empirical question. Analytical studies have started to examine the optimal contract that aligns buyer-supplier incentives in joint NPD projects, but empirical evidence is scarce about the actual contracts offered by buying companies. Bridging the analytical and empirical literature, this paper compares optimal contracting derived from a parsimonious analytical model with actual behaviors observed in an experiment. In particular, we focus on how project uncertainty, buying company effort share, and buyer risk aversion influence three contractual decisions: total investment level, revenue share and fixed fee. Our results indicate significant differences between the optimal and actual behaviors. We identify various types of non-optimal contractual behaviors, which we explain from a risk aversion as well as a bounded rationality perspective. Overall, our findings contribute to the literature by showing that (1) the actual contractual behaviors could differ significantly from the optimal ones, (2) the actual contract design is sensitive to changes in project uncertainty and buying company effort share, and (3) the significant roles of risk aversion and bounded rationality in explaining the non-optimal contractual behaviors."
The digitalization of operations and supply chain management: Theoretical and methodological implications,Jan Holmström,08 December 2019,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1073,"AbstractThe digitalization of intra- and inter-organizational processes offers significant opportunity for research in the field of operations and supply chain management (OSCM). This essay summarizes the contributions of the special issue articles, highlighting their focus on additive manufacturing and the encapsulation of design and production information in a digital artifact. We conceptualize the digital artifact as containing the digital genes of the associated physical object. Digital encapsulation thus involves the integration of product design information with additional information on how that design is to be translated into a physical object, delivered to the customer, and used. Building on insights from the special issue articles, we identify three pathways by which digital encapsulation affects OSCM practice, as well as theory elaboration and extension. First, digital encapsulation allows each unique digitally encapsulated artifact to be acted on independently by OSCM systems. Second, digital encapsulation enables the redistribution of activities across organizational and geographic landscapes. Third, digital encapsulation facilitates interactivity of the digital artifact with external environment inputs. We conclude with a number of directions for future research."
Creativity and productivity in product design for additive manufacturing: Mechanisms and platform outcomes of remixing,Sascha Friesike,29 April 2019,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2018.10.004,"AbstractThe present study explores the phenomenon of remixing in product design for additive manufacturing (AM). In contrast to other manufacturing techniques, AM offers unprecedented flexibility in adapting existing product designs to changing requirements. However, in order to benefit from this potential, structured design procedures and tools are indispensable. As a possible solution, online platforms for collaborative 3D model creation are increasingly implementing features for remixing, a concept describing the creation of new models on the foundation of existing design elements. Against this backdrop, the objective of this research is to provide evidence for the value of remixing as an organizational intervention for improving product design processes. To this end, we present a mixed methods approach using data from Thingiverse, the world's largest AM-related online community. In a first step, we investigate qualitative data from 81 individual remix-based designs to identify the underlying mechanisms of remixing. We identify six such mechanisms that can further be grouped by the intended outcome of the respective process (creativity-oriented: inspiration, play, learning;productivity-oriented: speed, improvement, empowerment). In a second step, we turn to a quantitative analysis of platform data, which indicates that remixing may lead to better design process outcomes in terms of quantity and diversity of designs. Furthermore, we find that designs created by remixing designers are significantly more often printed by community members suggesting that remixing helps ensure manufacturing compatibility akin to continuous process improvement. Our research has several implications for individual designers and organizations engaging with product design for AM."
Economies of collaboration in build-to-model operations,Carl Philip T. Hedenstierna,01 April 2019,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1014,"AbstractThe direct-from-model and tool-less manufacturing process of 3D printing (3DP) embodies a general-purpose technology, facilitating capacity sharing and outsourcing. Starting from a case study of a 3DP company (Shapeways) and a new market entrant (Panalpina), we develop dynamic practices for partial outsourcing in build-to-model manufacturing. We propose a new outsourcing scheme,bidirectional partial outsourcing(BPO), where 3D printers share capacity by alternating between the role of outsourcer and subcontractor based on need. Coupled withorder book smoothing(OBS), where orders are released gradually to production, this provides 3D printers with two distinct ways to manage demand variability. By combining demand and cost field data with an analytical model, we find that BPO improves 3DP cost efficiency and delivery performance as the number of 3DP firms in the network increases. OBS is sufficient for an established 3D printer when alternatives to in-house manufacturing are few, or of limited capacity. Nevertheless, OBS comes at the cost of reduced responsiveness, whereas BPO shifts the cost and delivery performance frontier. Our analysis shows how BPO combined with OBS makes 3DP companies more resilient to downward movements in both demand and price levels."
The microfoundations of an operational capability in digital manufacturing,Samuel Roscoe,06 June 2019,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1044,"AbstractThis article seeks insights into how individuals, processes, and structures interact to form the microfoundations of an operational capability in digital manufacturing. Using a knowledge-based theory lens, we develop an empirical framework that explains how structures and processes encourage individuals to interact and share knowledge, and through these interactions, operating routines and operational capabilities emerge. The model is further refined using data collected from 40 interviews, steering committee meetings and participant observations at a high technology aerospace company. We find that discrete technologies, used in one component or subassembly, can be developed within authority-based hierarchies using rigid new product development processes. We also find that whole system technologies that affect multiple aspects of the final product require flexible processes and consensus-based hierarchical structures. Consensus-based structures include centers of competence, which provide individuals the freedom to “learn through failure” and develop flexible ad hoc problem solving processes. Such flexible processes encourage individuals to learn from their mistakes and share new knowledge on a repetitive basis, leading to the emergence of operating routines. The paper contributes to the knowledge-based view by empirically demonstrating how different types of new technology development programs, be they for discrete or whole system technologies, may benefit from different configurations of flexible/rigid processes and authority-based/consensus-based structures."
On the economics of additive manufacturing: Experimental findings,Martin Baumers,25 August 2019,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1053,"AbstractAdditive manufacturing offers great potential for both product and process innovation in manufacturing across a wide range of industry sectors. To date, most applications that have been reported use additive manufacturing to produce either customized parts or produce at small scale, while the volume manufacture of standard parts largely remains a conjecture. In this article, we report on a series of experiments designed to elucidate how quantity, quality and cost relate in additive manufacturing processes. Our findings show that traditional economies of scale only partially apply to additive manufacturing processes. We also identify four build failure modes and quantify their combined effect on unit cost, exposing an unusual property whereby the cost-optimal operating point occurs below maximum machine capacity utilization. Furthermore, once additive manufacturing technology is used at full capacity utilization, we find no evidence of a positive effect of increased volume on unit cost. We do, however, identify learning curve effects related to process repetition and operator experience. Based on our findings we propose a set of general characteristics of the additive manufacturing process for further testing."
Assessing the potential of additive manufacturing for the provision of spare parts,J. Jakob Heinen,02 September 2019,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1054,"AbstractSpare parts are a particularly interesting application for switching production from traditional manufacturing (TM) to additive manufacturing (AM). Research assessing AM has primarily addressed cost models centering on the production process or the operations management of separate spare parts. By combining case study, modeling, and design science elements, we adopt a holistic perspective and develop a design to examine the systematic leverage of AM in spare parts operations. Contextually grounded in problems faced by a leading material handling equipment manufacturer that is challenged by common characteristics of after-sales operations, we engage with practice to propose a portfolio level analysis examining the switchover share from TM to AM. Using a data set of 53,457 spare parts over 9 years, we find that up to 8% of stock keeping units (SKUs) and 2% of total units supplied could be produced using AM, even if unit production costs are four times those of TM. This result is driven by low demand, high fixed costs, and minimum order quantities in TM. Finally, we present the evaluation by the case company's management and highlight five areas of opportunity and challenge."
Consumer motivation for product disposal and its role in acquiring products for reuse,Dayna Simpson,26 June 2019,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1049,"AbstractProduct reuse is most profitable where manufacturers acquire used products in the best possible condition—near new and with little wear and tear. This requires consumers, however, to dispose of products that still work and may still be in use. Prior scholarship on acquiring consumer products for reuse focuses on consumer “returns”—products consumers find fault with, or bought in error. These, however, are a fraction of all products sold to consumers and available for reuse. Importantly, returns are motivated by a different set of factors, than product “disposal.” We explore how psychological ownership influences consumer disposal of reusable products. Across three studies of Australian consumers, we found two psychological tendencies (attachment and frugality) increased product retention. We also found, that infrequent product use, and emotional reward, could weaken ownership and encourage disposal of products that are attractive for reuse. To our knowledge, no behavioral studies in the product acquisition literature deal with consumers before or during product disposal. We highlight a role for consumers in product acquisition, as well as contribute to the consumer psychology and mental accounting literature, and identify significant opportunity for manufacturers to leverage consumers' psychological tendencies to improve the collection of reusable products."
Work after work: The impact of new service delivery models on work hours,Hessam Bavafa,08 August 2019,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1052,"AbstractIn many professional service organizations (PSOs), a single server such as a physician or lawyer delivers services to customers across multiple channels. In these settings, there exists a risk that work obligations encroach on the personal lives of the servers. We empirically examine this concern in the primary care setting of physicians providing care to patients following the introduction of a new service delivery channel, e-visits. Our data cover an 8.5-year timespan and include 3.3 million patient encounters, including about one million e-visits. We find that e-visit adoption nearly doubles the number of hours containing work (defined as office visits or e-visits) each week. Of the additional hours containing such work, only 49% are in weekday business hours; the rest are in weekday evenings or early mornings (37%) and on weekends (14%). We also show that increases in office or e-visit workloads lead to more post-workday activity in the e-visit channel. We conclude the analysis by examining the impact of these workloads on e-visit work content, as measured by the number of words and amount of time spent on each e-visit; we estimate precise but practically small effects of workload on these work content outcomes."
Supersize me? Franchisee size and voluntary compliance with corporate brand-building initiatives,Brett Massimino,11 September 2019,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1056,"AbstractWe examine the effects of a franchisee's size, distance from headquarters, and local competition on voluntary compliance with corporate brand-building initiatives at the outlet level. Specifically, we consider compliance with a corporate social responsibility effort to solicit charitable donations at the time of retail checkout, measuring compliance performance as the amount of donations received at each outlet. Our analysis utilizes an objective, longitudinal sample of 777 franchised outlets in a national quick-service restaurant chain. Surprisingly, we find that distance from headquarters is positively related to compliance; we relate this finding to recent, extant research on geographic distances and franchisee behaviors. We find the beneficial effects of larger, multiunit franchisees are mitigated as franchisees' geographic distances from headquarters increase; we relate these findings to horizontal agency within franchising systems. We further find that franchised outlets in more competitive markets comply less with brand-building initiatives, even less so when part of a larger franchisee network. Our results underscore the important moderating role franchisee size plays in outlets' compliance, which we link back to extant perspectives on agency theory. Supplemental analyses consider tensions between compliance and operational efficiency, as well as effects of hypothesized factors on another mandatory form of compliance."
"The effect of firm size, asset ownership, and market prices on regulatory violations",Alex Scott,17 October 2019,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1059,"AbstractAn individual's temptation to violate regulations for personal gain increases with the economic payoff to do so. Firms, however, adopt strategies to reduce undesirable behavior from their employees. This article examines how individuals change their propensity to violate regulations as the price for their services varies. We posit that individuals will commit more intentional, but not unintentional, violations as the payoff to do so increases, and that this effect will be moderated by the size of the firm for whom he or she works and whether the firm or the individual owns the assets used for production. To test our hypotheses, we link data from millions of inspections of truck driver logbooks with spot market prices observed over the same 4-year period. We find that drivers who operate independently intentionally violate restrictions on their work hours more frequently when prices increase—violating 34% more frequently when prices are at their highest versus lowest—but larger firms and the firm's ownership of the assets reduce a driver's responsiveness to price changes. At the extreme, drivers for large asset-owning firms are completely unresponsive to prices. Asset-owning drivers are responsive to market prices, even for the largest firms."
Intervention as a research strategy,Rogelio Oliva,17 October 2019,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1065,"AbstractThe Journal of Operations Management (JOM) has made design science central to its development strategy, creating a department to incubate papers using this methodology. An inaugural editorial published in 2016 called for papers with a generic design supported by adesign propositionthat provides pragmatic guidelines to bridge the gap between the case specific and the universal. In this article, I propose ways in which the scope of interventions can be expanded beyond the editorial's proposal to foster theoretical developments and better align with JOM's mission. I propose that, rather than focus on the design propositions, we explore the role that interventions (the ultimate manifestation of design science) can play in testing and developing theory (the ultimate goal of an academic endeavor). Taking as a point of departure the principles ofaction researchand the explanatory framework ofprocess theories, I propose two modes of research for leveraging interventions as a mechanism for testing existing theory and develop theories about organizational and system transformation. I illustrate the application of these two frameworks in the context of a previously published article."
Deviations from aspirational target levels and environmental and safety performance: Implications for operations managers acting irresponsibly,Frank Wiengarten,09 June 2019,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1032,"AbstractThe relationship between sustainable operations and a firm's financial performance has been an ongoing focus of operations management scholars. Previous literature has extensively explored the impact of acting responsibly on financial performance. This article applies the behavioral theory of the firm and prospect theory to assess the much-neglected reverse relationship, exploring whether a firm's relative aspirational financial performance impacts its likelihood of acting irresponsibly. Furthermore, we explore whether operational slack in the form of capacity, productivity, and inventory attenuates a firm's likelihood of acting irresponsibly when its actual financial performance deviates from its aspirational level. We use a matched pair design with privately held manufacturing firms in the United Kingdom who acted irresponsibly matched with similar firms who did not act irresponsibly. While most firms do not act irresponsibly, we find that the further a firm moves (positively or negatively) from its aspirational level of financial performance, the more likely it is to act irresponsibly. The results also indicate that slack generally does not prevent managers from acting irresponsibly, especially when performing relatively well. This study contributes to the sustainable operations literature and provides important theoretical, managerial, and policy implications."
The role of intellectual capital in new product development: Can it become a liability?,Annapoornima M. Subramanian,30 May 2019,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1045,"ABSTRACTGiven the increasingly high cost of new product development (NPD), it is important for firms to terminate unsuccessful NPD projects as soon as possible. This article investigates the role of intellectual capital in the discontinuation of NPD projects. The three dimensions of intellectual capital (human, structural, and social capital) are posited to decrease the likelihood of discontinuation of NPD projects, while contextual factors such as the firm's discontinuation experience and the size of the drug development portfolio are expected to affect this relationship. The research model is tested using a unique data set of 1,168 drug discovery and development projects. The results suggest that NPD projects rich in all three dimensions of intellectual capital are less likely to be discontinued. The size of the firm's drug development portfolio, however, is found to mitigate these effects, while discontinuation experience enhances the relationship between intellectual capital and discontinuation duration. As only a fraction of new product development initiatives result in success, timely discontinuation of unsuccessful projects is critical for sustained performance of organizations. Our findings make an important contribution to this stream of work. By highlighting the role of intellectual capital in the discontinuation process, we offer an interesting twist to the literature that invariably assumes intellectual capital to be important for innovation."
Spillover effects of supply chain news on consumers' perceptions of product quality: An examination within the triple bottom line,Bridget Satinover Nichols,09 June 2019,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1033,"AbstractThe purpose of this research is to examine the impact that news about supply chain operations related to the triple bottom line (TBL) has on consumers' perceptions. Specifically, it focuses on how sustainability successes and failures in a company's supply chain operations influence consumer perceptions of product quality. These perceptions are based on aspillover effect. The research study is set up across three experiments. Study one tests for the spillover effect in supply chain TBL-related news and demonstrates that negative supply chain news across all three TBL dimensions reduces quality perceptions. Study two examines the effect across three levels of negative news intensity and finds that the spillover effect is consistent, even with stronger levels of negativity. Study three investigates whether a firm can improve damaged quality perceptions and purchase intentions through a recovery effort. The results of study three suggest that consumers' perceptions and purchase intentions are generally reparable. Collectively, the findings should encourage firms to more rigorously consider how news about their supply chain operations may impact consumers' perceptions and intentions toward the firm's products."
Taking stock of consumer returns: A review and classification of the literature,Huseyn Abdulla,16 July 2019,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1047,"AbstractCoincident with the rapid growth of consumer returns and their corresponding importance in the retail marketplace, academic interest in the area of consumer return policy design has significantly increased. In fact, the growth in academic publications has been tremendous, with almost half of the published works appearing within the past 6 years. The influx of new and evolving research spans across multiple disciplines and various methodologies. To provide clarity for the continued evolution of the field, we provide a comprehensive review and classification of the literature predicated on a holistic conceptual framework. The scope of the review includes all peer reviewed journal articles published prior to the end of 2018, along with any working papers cited therefrom, that specifically address (a) managerial decision-making related to return policies or (b) consumer behavior in response to such decision-making. Examining the state of the literature and practice on return policy design through the lens of a unified conceptual framework—a framework that spans both analytical and empirical research—reveals numerous managerial and theoretical opportunities for future research."
Does supply chain visibility affect operating performance? Evidence from conflict minerals disclosures,Caroline Swift,08 April 2019,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1021,"AbstractFirms are increasingly held accountable for their suppliers' transgressions. Consequently, firms need to develop upstream visibility to exercise control over their supply chains. An emerging body of work has recognized the importance of supply chain visibility and has examined it using analytical models, behavioral methods, and case studies. Still, large-sample empirical evidence on the benefits of supply chain visibility remains elusive. We seek to bridge this gap by examining conflict minerals disclosures (mandated by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act) and financial reports to evaluate whether firms with greater visibility into their conflict minerals supply chains achieve improved operating and market performance. We use the data from conflict minerals disclosures (Form SD) to distinguish between firms that have high or low visibility into their conflict minerals sources. Then, we use event study methods to analyze differences in operating and market performance between firms with high visibility and firms with low visibility. We find that firms with high visibility into their conflict minerals supply chains achieve higher profitability than comparable firms with less visibility. In addition, we find that firms with high visibility into their conflict minerals supply chains realize improved sales performance and stock market valuations. Our results are relevant to managers because they show that firms can attain operational and market benefits by improving visibility in their supply chains."
An empirical study of the behavior of patients who leave the emergency department without being seen,Ehsan Bolandifar,22 May 2019,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1030,"AbstractQueue abandonment has a significant impact on system performance. However, the key drivers for abandonment, particularly in observable systems, are not well understood. To better inform our understanding of abandonment behavior, we study the effect of three operational drivers of abandonment from a hospital emergency department (ED), namely, waiting time, queue length, and observed service rate. We confirm that all three factors affect a patient's propensity for leaving the waiting area without being seen by a physician (LWBS), that is, abandoning the queue. Further, these factors interact with each other in a nonlinear fashion. Both ED crowding and observed service rate influence a patient's perception of waiting time. Moreover, patients are not homogenous in their abandonment response, and we observe behavior that is distinct for patients with severe conditions. Specifically, patients who report to a congested ED with more severe conditions are more inclined to abandon the ED early in the process compared to patients with less severe conditions. Further, we observe that patients with severe conditions who elect to remain in the crowded ED exhibit less sensitivity to waiting time and observed service rate than other patient types. We discuss the implications of this observed abandonment behavior on ED management."
Forecasting for remanufacturing: The effects of serialization,Thanos E. Goltsos,03 June 2019,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1031,"ABSTRACTRemanufacturing operations rely upon accurate forecasts of demand and returned items. Return timing and quantity forecasts help estimate net demand (demand minus returns) requirements. Based on a unique data set of serialized transactional issues and returns from the Excelitas Group and one of their defense contractors, Qioptiq, we assess the empirical performance of some key methods in the area of returns forecasting. We extend their application (for net demand forecasting), by considering that demand is also subject to uncertainty and thus needs to be forecast. Information on remanufacturing costs allows for an evaluation of the inventory implications of such forecasts under various settings. A foray into the literature on information technologies enables a discussion on the interface between information availability and forecast accuracy and utility. We find that serialization accounts for considerable forecast accuracy benefits, and that the accuracy of demand forecasts is as important as that of returns. Further, we show how the combined returns and demand forecast uncertainty affects the inventory performance. Finally, we identify opportunities for further improvements for the operations of Qioptiq, and for remanufacturing operations in general."
"Demand and order-fulfillment planning: The impact of point-of-sale data, retailer orders and distribution center orders on forecast accuracy",Arunachalam Narayanan,23 April 2019,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1026,"AbstractIndustry consultants claim that investing in systems that base forecasting on point-of-sale (POS) data throughout the supply chain will improve forecast accuracy. We explore what actually happens to forecast accuracy for demand and order-fulfillment planning when the forecast demand signal is based on POS, retailer orders, or distribution center (DC) orders. We begin by comparing the forecast accuracy for different demand signals using daily demand and operating data from a large consumer-products supply chain. We then extend the analysis by varying the demand and supply-chain parameters to evaluate their impact on demand signal performance. We find that POS data improve forecast accuracy for demand planning but not for order-fulfillment planning. These findings thus challenge consulting-firm claims about the ability of POS-based forecasting systems to improve forecast accuracy across all contexts."
Theoretical and empirical evidence of behavioral and production line factors that influence helping behavior,David E. Cantor,19 March 2019,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1019,"AbstractA poorly motivated workforce can have a negative impact on the productivity of production lines and firm performance. One factor that can counter the effects of poorly performing workers is if stronger colleagues step in and assist them. Leveraging theory from the organizational citizenship behavior literature, this study examines how behavioral and production line factors influence individuals to help team members in a production line experiment. Study findings are that perceptions of social loafing and material-handling ambiguity influence team helping behavior. Empirical evidence also suggests that perceptions of social loafing mediate the relationship of team altruism on helping behavior. Post hoc analyses are conducted to further explore how the behavioral and production factors influence helping behavior. Strategies for promoting volitional helping behavior are discussed."
Who pays you to be green? How customers' environmental practices affect the sales benefits of suppliers' environmental practices,Chien-Ming Chen,22 March 2019,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1018,"AbstractThis article examines whether a supplier's sales from a customer depends on the supplier's engagement in pro-environmental practices (PEPs), and how this relationship is moderated by the customer's PEP level. This article synthesizes findings from several streams of literature including corporate environmental management, supply chain management, and contingency theory. We hypothesize that (1) a supplier gets greater sales benefits from its PEPs when the (corporate) customer's PEP level is higher, and (2) a supplier gets higher sales from a customer when the supplier's PEP level aligns with the customer's PEP level. To test the hypotheses, we use data from public U.S. manufacturing firms and their key customers between 2006 and 2016. The results show that the effect of a manufacturer's PEPs on sales is significantly higher when the customer's PEP level is higher. The results also show that a manufacturer's sales from a particular customer are higher when the manufacturer's PEP level does not exceed the customers' PEP level. This study provides empirical evidence that an investment in PEPs does not always enhance sales—the sales effect of PEPs may vary according to the customer's PEP level. To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale study that examines the effect of environmental practices on sales."
Operational efficiency and patient-centered health care: A view from online physician reviews,Dong-Gil Ko,05 April 2019,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1028,"AbstractOnline reviews are playing an increasingly important role in how patients select and evaluate health-care providers. Physician rating websites not only act as open platforms for patients to share their experiences, but can also offer valuable feedback for physicians to improve the quality of care. In this study, we analyze over one million physician reviews across 17 medical specialties and investigate the relationship between operational efficiency and patient satisfaction. We combine econometrics models with text analytics techniques to quantify the effect using both patients' ratings of physicians and their qualitative review narratives. The results provide strong empirical evidence that operational inefficiency negatively influences patient satisfaction. Specifically, a waiting time longer than 17 min will, on average, reduce the odds of getting a high rating status by 14%. Though many health care ratings examined in this study do not mitigate the negative effects brought on by long waiting time, patient narratives reflecting the importance of technical and interpersonal qualities to patients suggest a more complex set of relationships between waiting time and patient satisfaction. Our study showcases the usefulness of online physician reviews and reveals unique insights for improving the delivery of patient-centered health care."
Avoiding bias and fallacy in survey research: A behavioral multilevel approach,Mikko Ketokivi,22 March 2019,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1011,"AbstractMuch like researchers in general management and organization theory interested in organization-level phenomena, operations management researchers theorize and analyze entire operational systems, such as factories, supply chains, airports, or hospital wards. In discussing threats to measurement validity, we tend to focus on motivational factors such as social desirability, acquiescence, and other self-serving biases. In this paper, I seek to complement these discussions by examining the broader question of how individual-level responses can provide information on system-level traits. In an empirical illustration, I apply multilevel factor analysis to examine the factor structure of organizational commitment in a sample of 2,355 informants embedded within 265 manufacturing plants. The conclusion is that understanding the multilevel essence of theoretical concepts is crucial and that confounding levels may lead to inferences that are not only biased but—much worse—fallacious."
"It worked there, so it should work here: Sustaining change while improving product development processes",Shawn T. Collins,22 March 2019,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1010,"AbstractOrganizations operate under ongoing pressure to conduct product development (PD) in ways that reduce errors, improve product designs, and increase speed and efficiency. Often, managers are expected to respond to this pressure by implementingprocess improvement programs(PIPs) based on best practices elsewhere (e.g., in another part of their organization or in another industrial context). Successful PIP implementation depends on two criteria: (a) demonstrating (symbolic) success by meeting externally imposed deadlines and producing mandated artifacts and (b) sustaining the expected (substantive) changes in their employees' underlying beliefs and practices. Given the mixed success of PIPs in nonmanufacturing contexts, identifying factors that contribute to both symbolic and substantive implementation is important to both researchers and practitioners. We explore this challenge through an in-depth field study at a PD company (DevCo) that implemented a PIP across its 11 PD projects. We examine DevCo's change message to implement the PIP, how DevCo's engineers experienced it, factors that impeded implementation, and factors that could improve substantive success. Along with this empirical evidence, we leverage organizational change concepts to facilitate effective PIP implementation in new contexts such as PD. We distill our findings into eight propositions that expand theory about effectively transferring PIPs across contexts."
An empirical analysis of supply chain finance adoption,David A. Wuttke,12 April 2019,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1023,"AbstractSupply chain finance (SCF) makes the funding of the supply chain more efficient because it extends the financial strengths of buyers to their suppliers. Nevertheless, buyers sometimes struggle to persuade suppliers to adopt SCF quickly. To craft more effective supplier onboarding strategies, buyers need to know which suppliers are likely to adopt SCF faster. Drawing on the theoretical perspective on organizational motivation, we develop a research framework that uncovers the key drivers of supplier adoption speed. Our framework combines efficiency motive drivers, identified by recent analytical studies on SCF, with legitimacy motive drivers, which stem from a supplier's institutional environment and are new to the SCF literature. We test our hypotheses using a unique data set from a leading financial technology platform provider. We find that suppliers with more limited access to financing tend to adopt SCF faster. In addition, suppliers adopt SCF faster if such adoption is associated with more pronounced reductions in their financing costs. Legitimacy motive drivers also impact supplier adoption speed. Specifically, our results suggest that mimetic and normative pressures accelerate the speed at which suppliers adopt SCF, while coercive pressures seem to have such an effect only when the buyer's stakes are high."
Why do surgeons schedule their own surgeries?,David Johnston,28 March 2019,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1012,"AbstractSurgery is a knowledge intensive, high-risk professional service. Most hospitals give surgeons considerable autonomy in deciding which patients to operate on and when. In theory, this allows surgeons the operational flexibility to prioritize surgeries based on intimate knowledge of their patient's clinical needs. At odds with this strategy is the operations management literature, which favors the standardization and centralization of scheduling focused on achieving the efficient use of all resources, such as operating room capacity. Unfortunately, a little is known as to how surgeons customize their schedules and why they value such control. To this end, we conduct an exploratory qualitative study of the scheduling behavior of surgeons at a large Canadian teaching hospital. We identify significant differences between surgeons as to their priorities when scheduling. Two constructs are formative in surgeon decision-making: the timeliness of treatment for their patients and idiosyncratic personal priorities. Our work has implications for achieving surgeon support for initiatives to standardize and centralize routines for patient scheduling. Accordingly, we formulate propositions that address the conditions under which such efforts will achieve the desired balance between flexibility and efficiency."
Fleet sizing for UNHCR country offices,Nathan Kunz,26 March 2019,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1013,"AbstractVehicles are important assets generating significant costs. Relief organizations frequently struggle to define the appropriate number of vehicles to support their operations. The high level of decentralization giving country offices the autonomy to decide on the size of their fleet complicates the issue. This study follows a design science approach in collaboration with the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). We develop a prediction model to support UNHCR's fleet sizing problem. A stepwise linear regression approach is used to construct a model able to predict the number of vehicles required by each country office based on data from comparable countries. Three variables have the best predictive accuracy: the number of locations, small partners, and large partners working for UNHCR. We validate our findings with different regression methods and by applying our approach to another organization. Our model has provided UNHCR with valuable indications on how to help determine the appropriate number of vehicles in many countries. We develop three design propositions that show how our approach can be generalized to other humanitarian operations. These propositions offer insights on how to implement a fleet sizing decision process in highly decentralized humanitarian operations with limited information on optimal fleet sizes."
Revisiting the complex adaptive systems paradigm: Leading perspectives for researching operations and supply chain management issues,Anand Nair,25 March 2019,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1022,"AbstractThis paper presents a conceptual model for a renewed consideration of the complex adaptive systems (CAS) perspective in operations and supply chain management research. A literature review identifies the approaches taken in published research to examine issues such as complexity, adaptation, and emergent behavior. We present a revised conceptual framework that offers directions for embracing key tenets from CAS research so as to gain deeper insights into pertinent issues within the field. We introduce the articles that are part of this special issue and highlight how these articles relate to the conceptual framework proposed in the paper. We also propose some methodological directions that can help in undertaking rigorous investigations of some important aspects that have theoretical and managerial significance."
"Process network modularity, commonality, and greenhouse gas emissions",Kevin J. Dooley,18 March 2019,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1007,"AbstractA process network is a complex system of linked unit processes that constitute the life cycle of a product. In this article, we consider how the structural and functional characteristics of a product's process network impact the network's collective greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. At a unit process level, GHG emissions are primarily related to process efficiency. We hypothesize that a process network's GHG emissions will be less when the process network has a modular structure and when its constituent unit processes are more functionally similar. A modular process network architecture promotes autonomous innovation and improvements in knowledge management and problem-solving capabilities, leading to more efficient processes. Functional commonality in a process network enables economies of scale and knowledge spillover and also leads to process efficiencies, thus reducing GHG emissions. We test these two hypotheses using a sample of 4,189 process networks extracted from an environmental life cycle inventory database. Empirical results support our hypotheses, and we discuss the implications of our findings for product development and supply network design."
Temporary deembedding buyer – supplier relationships: A complexity perspective,Fabian J. Sting,18 March 2019,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1008,"AbstractResearch on buyer–supplier relationships has debated the advantages and disadvantages of embedded relationships. We join this debate by developing theory on the performance implications of relaxing embedded buyer–supplier relationships for a limited period of time—a previously neglected phenomenon we refer to astemporary deembedding. To capture this phenomenon's dynamic and complex nature, we use a combined-method approach. First, we conducted a longitudinal case study of the relationship between Nissan and a strategic first-tier supplier. This case study suggests that temporary deembedding reinvigorates search and leads to higher performance for both the buyer and supplier. Second, we built a computational simulation model using the search perspective from complexity theory to complement the theory grounded in our case study. Our simulations confirm the case findings while shedding additional light on how frequency, duration, and intensity of deembedding affect supply chain performance."
Identifying dynamical instabilities in supply networks using generalized modeling,Güven Demirel,18 March 2019,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1005,"AbstractSupply networks need to exhibit stability in order to remain functional. Here, we apply a generalized modeling (GM) approach, which has a strong pedigree in the analysis of dynamical systems, to study the stability of real-world supply networks. It goes beyond purely structural network analysis approaches by incorporating material flows, which are defining characteristics of supply networks. The analysis focuses on the network of interactions between material flows, providing new conceptualizations to capture key aspects of production and inventory policies. We provide stability analyses of two contrasting real-world networks—that of an industrial engine manufacturer and an industry-level network in the luxury goods sector. We highlight the criticality of links with suppliers that involve the dispatch, processing, and return of parts or sub-assemblies, cyclic motifs that involve separate paths from a common supplier to a common firm downstream, and competing demands of different end products at specific nodes. Based on a critical discussion of our findings in the context of the supply chain management literature, we generate five propositions to advance knowledge and understanding of supply network stability. We discuss the implications of the propositions for the effective management, control, and development of supply networks. The GM approach enables fast screening to identify hidden vulnerabilities in extensive supply networks."
An empirical investigation of transaction dynamics in online surplus networks: A complex adaptive system perspective,Suvrat Dhanorkar,25 March 2019,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1006,"AbstractOnline material and waste exchanges (OMWEs) provide an online platform connecting suppliers of surplus material with potential buyers. These exchanges aim to improve the environment by helping industrial organizations repurpose surplus material and avoid landfill disposal. OMWEs represent an emergingsurplus-driven supply network, which exhibits different internal complexities and dynamics from traditional supply networks, with similarly distinct transactional patterns and outcomes. Drawing on complex adaptive system (CAS) theory, this study investigates how the complex network adapts to alter the likelihood of transactions between buyers and suppliers. Using data fromMNExchange.org, an OMWE operating in the US state of Minnesota, we observe that, at the node level, buyers adapt their searches for products over time to increase transaction success; at the dyadic level, buyer–supplier pairing patterns adapt over time through homophilous relations to facilitate negotiations and increase transaction success; and at the network level, the entire exchange system structurally self-organizes to increase transaction rates. Throughout, buyers’ competition influences transaction success, contingent on whether the product has been on the market for a long time, and buyers with more experience more quickly identify favorable conditions (among products and suppliers) leading to higher transaction success than less experienced competitors. Overall, the results demonstrate multilevel network emergence, in which complex, adaptive, and longitudinal buyer–supplier interactions resolve uncertainty and increase transactions. These findings disentangle OMWEs' operation to allow managers and policymakers to increase the overall buyer–supplier transaction rates with an eye toward improved environmental outcomes."
Modelling supply chain adaptation for disruptions: An empirically grounded complex adaptive systems approach,Kang Zhao,25 March 2019,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1009,"AbstractThrough the development and usage of an agent-based model, this article investigates firms' adaptive strategies against disruptions in a supply chain network. Viewing supply chain networks as complex adaptive systems, we first construct and analyze a real-world supply chain network among 2,971 firms spanning 90 industry sectors. We then develop an agent-based simulation to show how the model of firms' adaptive behaviors can leverage competition relationships within a supply chain network. The simulation also models how disruptions propagate in the supply chain network through cascading failures. With the simulation, we seek to understand if a firm's adaptive behaviors can reduce the impact of disruptions in supply chain networks. Therefore, we propose, evaluate, and analyze two types of adaptive strategies a firm can leverage to reduce the negative effects of supply chain network disruptions. First, we deploy in our model a reactive strategy, which restructures the network in response to a disruption event among first-tier suppliers. Next, we develop and propose proactive strategies, which are used when a distant disruption is observed but has not yet hit the focal firm. We discuss the implications related to how and when firms can improve their resilience against supply disruptions by leveraging adaptive strategies."
Remanufacturing and consumers' risky choices: Behavioral modeling and the role of ambiguity aversion,James D. Abbey,19 March 2019,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1001,"AbstractWillingness to pay (WTP) is known to be lower for remanufactured products than for comparable new products. Normative work to date has assumed that a consumer's WTP for a remanufactured product is a fraction, called discount factor, of the consumer's WTP for a corresponding new product, and that this discount factor is constant across consumers. Recent empirical research demonstrates, however, that the discount factor is not constant across consumers. This discovery has led researchers to call for an exploration of more refined utility models that incorporate heterogeneous risk preferences through elements such as risk aversion, loss aversion, and ambiguity aversion. To address this call, this article assesses each of these risk preference elements by empirically deriving WTP distributions from two interlinked studies. To provide triangulation in both the empirical method and sample, the interlinked studies employ an online survey and a laboratory experiment that elicits WTP for framed lotteries that proxy the situation of buying remanufactured products. The empirical results and robustness verifications demonstrate that a parsimonious standard utility model incorporating only risk aversion explains the WTP data reasonably well."
Contracting outsourced services with collaborative key performance indicators,Henk Akkermans,18 March 2019,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1002,"AbstractWhile service outsourcing may benefit from the application of performance-based contracts (PBCs), the implementation of such contracts is usually challenging. Service performance is often not only dependent on supplier effort but also on the behavior of the buying firm. Existing research on performance-based contracting provides very limited understanding on how this challenge may be overcome. This article describes a design science research project that develops a novel approach to buyer–supplier contracting, using collaborative key performance indicators (KPIs). Collaborative KPIs evaluate and reward not only the supplier contribution to customer performance but also the customer's behavior to enable this. In this way, performance-based contracting can also be applied to settings where supplier and customer activities are interdependent, while traditional contracting theories suggest that output controls are not effective under such conditions. In the collaborative KPI contracting process, indicators measure both supplier and customer (buying firm) performance and promote collaboration by being defined through a collaborative process and by focusing on end-of-process indicators. The article discusses the original case setting of a telecommunication service provider experiencing critical problems in outsourcing IT services. The initial intervention implementing this contracting approach produced substantial improvements, both in performance and in the relationship between buyer and supplier. Subsequently, the approach was tested and evaluated in two other settings, resulting in a set of actionable propositions on the efficacy of collaborative KPI contracting. Our study demonstrates how defining, monitoring, and incentivizing the performance of specific processes at thebuying firmcan help alleviate the limitations of traditional performance-based contracting when the supplier's liability for service performance is difficult to verify."
Promoting adoption of management practices from the outside: Insights from a randomized field experiment,Quang Nguyen,22 March 2019,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2018.11.001,"AbstractWe conducted a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) to explore the role of government information intervention on a firm's management practices and performance. Specifically, we studied whether providing managers with information regarding the benefits of Quality Management practice (QM) can enable government to influence manager perception and adoption of QM, output quality, and firm performance. Our main finding demonstrates that the information intervention improves manager perception of QM benefits; this, in turn, encourages managers to adopt QM, leading to improvements in quality and firm performance."
"Response invalidity in empirical research: Causes, detection, and remedies",Jeffrey R. Edwards,22 March 2019,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2018.12.002,"AbstractResearch in behavioral operations management and related areas relies heavily on self-report measures. The utility of such measures depends on the extent to which the responses are valid, meaning they correspond to the thoughts and beliefs of respondents with regard to the phenomena under study. Response validity is undermined when respondents are unwilling or unable to provide adequate responses to survey questions, an issue that has generated an array of methods for screening and evaluating survey data and dealing with dubious responses. This article uses the work of Abbey and Meloy (2017) as a point of departure to examine the causes, detection, and remedies of response invalidity. The article concludes with recommendations for future research that treats response validity and its dimensions as methods factors that should be formally incorporated into statistical models."
Innovation in supply networks—A research framework and roadmap,Subodha Kumar,23 October 2020,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1122,
Supply base innovation and firm financial performance,Yan Dong,20 July 2020,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1107,"AbstractFirms are increasingly sourcing innovation from their supply chain partners. Meanwhile, supply chains have evolved into complex networks, which complicates the role that supply chain partners play in innovation and financial performance of firms. Previous research has mainly focused on the direct effect of innovation on a firm's financial performance, overlooking the innovativeness and complexity of supply networks. In this research, we focus on a firm's supply base, defined as the first tier of a supply network, and investigate the relationship between the intensity of R&D within the supply base and the financial performance of the focal firm. We also examine the moderating role of three aspects of supply base complexity—Number of suppliers, differentiation, and inter-relationships among suppliers. Utilizing secondary data from Bloomberg and Compustat, we find that the R&D intensity of a firm's supply base is positively associated with the firm's financial performance. Further, all three aspects of supply base complexity negatively moderate this relationship. These findings make important contributions to the literature by establishing a direct, positive relationship between supply base R&D and firm financial performance, which is attenuated by complexities within the supply base."
Exploring supplier–supplier innovations within the Toyota supply network: A supply network perspective,Antony Potter,08 October 2020,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1124,"AbstractThis article investigates the development of supplier–supplier innovations that occur when two firms that are part of the same supply network co-patent a new product. This study unravels how the structure of the supply network influences each firm's ability to form supplier–supplier innovations with other network members. Specifically, we investigate how supplier degree centrality influences the generation of supplier–supplier innovations, and the extent to which this relationship is moderated by the structural embeddedness of firms in the supply network. Using data from the Toyota supply network, the results reveal that a firm's ability to co-develop supplier–supplier innovations with other network members depends on its number of ties and their direction within the supply network. Although betweenness centrality has no significant moderating effect, closeness centrality, and embeddedness in small world clusters negatively moderate the relationship between supplier degree centrality and supplier–supplier innovations. Additionally, the number of manufacturing plants a firm operates in Japan strengthens the positive effect supplier degree centrality has on the development of supplier–supplier innovations."
Supplier innovation value from a buyer–supplier structural equivalence view: Evidence from the PACE awards in the automotive industry,Sangho Chae,06 November 2019,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1063,"AbstractWith the growing demand for smarter, cleaner, and safer cars, automotive original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are increasingly seeking novel inventions from innovative new or foreign suppliers. However, not all innovative suppliers are equally valuable for an OEM. When transforming novel inventions into products, OEMs could find it challenging to work with the suppliers with whom they lack trust or have limited shared understanding. In this study, we adopt a social capital perspective to understand how three types of social capital (i.e., structural, relational, and cognitive) influence a supplier's innovation value to the OEM. Hypotheses are tested using a unique data set combining the supply network structure and automotive supplier innovation award. Our results suggest that it is more difficult to obtain innovation value from a new or culturally distant foreign supplier. However, we also found that suppliers whose networks overlap more with the OEM's network are more likely to provide valuable innovations to the OEM, an effect that is stronger for culturally distant suppliers. This study contributes to the supply network and innovation literature by highlighting the importance of understanding the dyadic social capital between the buyer and supplier when evaluating innovation value of a supplier to a buying firm."
Is it too complex? The curious case of supply network complexity and focal firm innovation,Amalesh Sharma,12 December 2019,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1067,"AbstractFirms have increasingly relied on their supply network for improving their innovation performance. Although the relationship between the supply network structure and innovation has been investigated, the link between supply network complexity and a firm's innovation remains unexplored. By employing transaction cost economics and the concept of a recombinatory search, we propose that the complexity dimensions (horizontal, vertical, and spatial complexity) of a supply network impact the innovation performance of a firm and that such relationships are moderated by a strategic emphasis on value creation and the influence of the firm over the supply network. With a large-scale network data of 201 firms across six industries and 20 countries, we take a robust empirical approach that accounts for endogeneity, unobserved heterogeneity and intrafirm error correlation to test our theory. We find strong support for a nonlinear relationship (with diminishing growth) between both horizontal and vertical complexity with respect to innovation performance. We find that spatial complexity is negatively related to innovation performance. Additionally, we find that a firm's strategic emphasis and its influence indeed moderates the link between the complexity dimensions and innovation performance. Based on our findings, we offer specific managerial guidance for the effective implementation of sourcing practices."
The effects of product development network positions on product performance and confidentiality performance,Yingchao Lan,12 August 2020,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1105,"AbstractProduct development networks facilitate access to information, knowledge, and technologies that are otherwise difficult to obtain during innovation activities. Most current research on networks focuses on studying product performance benefits, but ignores the potential negative effects on confidentiality performance. Addressing this gap, we investigate how two key components of a firm's network position—network centrality and structural holes—affect both product and confidentiality performance. To do this, we assemble a panel of 1,468 electronic video games designed and developed by 591 developers over an 11-year period. We find that higher network centrality relates to better product performance but worse confidentiality performance. Meanwhile, firms spanning more structural holes enjoy better performance across both dimensions. In an exploratory analysis, we find that product novelty strengthens the positive relationship between network centrality and product performance but mutes the positive relationship between structural holes and product performance. We discuss the importance of these findings to the literature on innovation in inter-organizational networks."
"Administrative environmental innovations, supply network structure, and environmental disclosure",Marcus A. Bellamy,23 October 2020,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1114,"AbstractThis study contributes to a theoretical and empirical understanding of whether and how administrative environmental innovations (AEIs)—implemented to help track and manage a firm's environmental impacts—are related to environmental disclosure. Drawing on the Belief–Action–Outcome framework, we posit that the motivation of individuals (employees, managers, and the leadership) within the firm to access, use, and act on the environmental information available to them would be enhanced by the firm's implementation of AEIs, resulting in more extensive environmental disclosure by the firm. Additionally, building on the literature on supply chain networks, we posit that the structural position of the firm vis-à-vis its supply network—reflecting information flows, network learning, and status—moderates the AEI implementation–environmental disclosure relationship. To test our hypotheses, we build a multi-industry dataset of 3,106 firm-year observations based on 67,809 dyadic cost-of-goods-sold-based relationships obtained from Bloomberg's supply chain relationships database to construct the supply networks of focal firms. We also draw on Bloomberg's environmental, social, and governance (ESG) data for our AEI implementation and environmental disclosure measures. We find significant evidence to support our hypothesis that AEI implementation is positively associated with the extent of environmental disclosure. However, the implementation of both internal and external forms of AEIs has a more pronounced positive relationship with the extent of environmental disclosure, compared to the implementation of either form alone. With regard tosupply network structure, we identify three principal variables—accessibility,control, andinterconnectedness—that influence network learning and status of the focal firm and find that they moderate the AEI implementation–environmental disclosure relationship. We provide insights for theory and practice based on our findings."
Trading-off innovation novelty and information protection in supplier selection for a new product development project: Supplier ties as signals,Tingting Yan,06 January 2020,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1079,"AbstractA supplier's interorganizational ties can be a source of novelty as well as information leakage risk when a buyer involves suppliers in a new product development project. We use signaling theory to explain how supplier ties affect a purchasing manager's perception of suppliers. Three types of supplier ties are considered: ties with external innovation partners, with customers outside the buying firm's industry, and with the buying firm's competitors. We posit that managers use supplier ties as signals to indicate a supplier's potential in contributing to innovation novelty or information protection. Results from two scenario-based experiments with practicing managers support most of our hypotheses. When innovation novelty is the goal, managers perceive other-industry customer ties and external innovation ties as positive signals, while competitor ties as a negative signal. When information protection is the goal, all three types of ties are perceived negatively. When both goals are considered, information protection has a greater influence than innovation novelty on the final supplier selection likelihood."
Green supply chain management in Chinese firms: Innovative measures and the moderating role of quick response technology,Guo Li,29 November 2019,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1061,"AbstractThe last decade has witnessed a sharp rising trend in environmental awareness and protection in China. Green supply chain management (GSCM) has been regarded as an effective tool in China for mitigating the negative effects that firms have on the environment. However, the extent to which GSCM pressures influence GSCM practices, and whether and how GSCM practices affect GSCM performance are topics that remain under-explored. Combining Institutional Theory, Resource-Based View (RBV) Theory, and the literature on GSCM, our study sheds light on the relationship among GSCM pressures, practices, and performance under the moderating effect of quick response (QR) technology. Using statistical analysis of the collected data and case studies from companies in China, we establish several results. First, among different GSCM pressures, market and export pressures have significant impacts on GSCM practices, whereas cost pressure does not influence GSCM practices significantly. Second, internal improvement practice exerts a significant impact on GSCM practices, while external improvement practice negatively affects positive economic performance. In addition, ecology practice has significantly influenced environmental, positive economic, and operational performance. Third, QR technology suppresses the positive effect between internal improvement practice and negative economic performance. Two real cases from Huawei (telecommunications technologies) and Beijing Benz Automotive (automobile manufacturing) are conducted to verify the findings and generate additional insights. Our findings contribute to the literature and provide guidance to help governments and companies establish effective and innovative GSCM policies."
Perceived supplier opportunism in outsourcing relationships in emerging economies,Keith Skowronski,29 September 2020,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1123,"AbstractWhile opportunism has been a focus of transaction cost economics, perceived opportunism, where one party is perceived to be acting opportunistically when there is no opportunistic intent, can also lead to increased transaction costs in an exchange. In this study, consistent with forms of opportunism observed in our context of manufacturing outsourcing, we examine two different forms of perceived opportunism—perceived poaching and shirking. As narratives of the hidden costs of outsourcing discuss concerns of suppliers in emerging economies engaging in poaching and shirking, we examine if the level of economic development where a supplier operates affects perceptions of supplier poaching and shirking and also examine if the supplier's competitive priorities moderate those perceptions. To empirically test these relationships, we combine archival data of location characteristics with a dyadic primary dataset that captures perceived supplier opportunism, self-reported supplier opportunism, and other relationship characteristics. Our findings illustrate that perceived opportunism and opportunism are distinct constructs and that more observable forms of opportunism (i.e., shirking) affect perceived opportunism more than less observable forms of opportunism (i.e., poaching). We also find that, in existing relationships, manufacturers in advanced economies perceive poaching to be more strongly related to the level of economic development where a supplier operates than shirking. Finally, we find that while a cost focus can mitigate perceptions of poaching, an innovation focus exacerbates them. Overall, our study illustrates the challenges that innovation-focused suppliers in emerging economies face in regards to competing with suppliers in advanced economies."

Assessing customer return behaviors through data analytics,Michael E. Ketzenberg,12 March 2020,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1086,"AbstractRetailers often provide lenient, consumer-friendly return policies to reduce customers' perceived shopping risk and increase demand. As an unfortunate side effect for retailers, empirical findings demonstrate that lenient return policies lead some customers to abuse those return policies through opportunistic and even fraudulent behaviors. Customers can abuse return policies by making purchases with the full intention of returning the products or by returning a product long after extracting most of the product's market value. In doing so, abusive customers extract utility—physical, experiential, or financial—from these purchases, at little or no cost to themselves. However, retailers incur significant costs from such return abuse, with estimates topping $5.6 billion annually in the United States alone. Identifying customers who perpetrate return abuse remains a critical topic. Yet, as a construct, return abuse is difficult to define and to quantify. In contrast, legitimate returner and nonreturner customers exhibit different return behaviors with distinctly different transactional behaviors and profitability outcomes. To investigate these diverse returner behaviors, this study empirically analyzes a transactional secondary data set of over 1 million customers with over 75 million transactions from a national U.S.-based retailer. The analysis generates empirical insights that characterize observable customer actions related to abusive returners, legitimate returners, and nonreturners. This study introduces a set of predictive models that enable actionable managerial intervention and presents the opportunity to recapture significant returns costs that might otherwise be lost to avoidable return abuse. The analysis also highlights the need for a more holistic perspective toward predicting, managing, and preventing returns."
"Does social media elevate supply chain importance? An empirical examination of supply chain glitches, Twitter reactions, and stock market returns",Christoph G. Schmidt,31 March 2020,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1087,"AbstractWe build upon supply chain management and social media research by exploring the Twitter response to supply chain glitches and how this response may moderate the relationship between supply chain glitches and stock market returns. We analyze data on 213 supply chain glitches for 150 firms across 5 years and over 2 billion tweets on publicly traded firms. Leveraging event study methodology, we find support for our hypotheses. Using both volume and sentiment of tweets, we observe significant reactions on Twitter after supply chain glitches; tweet volume increases and tweets become more negative. We also find that Twitter reactions after a glitch accentuate the relationship between supply chain glitches and stock market returns, demonstrating how social media may elevate the prominence of supply chain problems. To address concerns associated with simultaneity bias, we demonstrate that pre-stock-market-open Twitter activity preempts post-stock-market-open returns. Finally, we conduct post hoc analyses that explore how firms can leverage Twitter to counteract the negative stock market consequences of Twitter, and how firm proximity to the end customer may influence how tweets moderate the stock market reaction to glitches."
Common institutional investors and supplier performance in supply chains,Yan-Leung Cheung,21 April 2020,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1089,"AbstractWe investigate how common institutional investors (CIIs) in supply chains affect supplier performance. Social network theory suggests that buyer–supplier relationships are influenced by networks of ties in which they are embedded. While prior research has concentrated on networks of trade interactions, we instead examine the influences of networks through common investors. Utilizing a large sample of buyer–supplier relationships, we find that the presence of CIIs improves suppliers' operating and market performance, especially for suppliers with greater dependence on buyers. In addition, supplier performance increases with the common ownership stakes held by CIIs, but decreases with the asymmetric ownership stakes of CIIs across supply chain partners. We find that better financial collaboration between the partners appears to be a mechanism through which CIIs enhance supplier performance. Lastly, we find that the role of CIIs in strengthening supplier performance is distinct from that of direct equity links. Collectively, our findings highlight a novel role of indirect cross-ownership in fostering supply chain collaboration and coordinating vertical relationships and, in turn, improving supplier performance."
How institutional pressures and managerial incentives elicit carbon transparency in global supply chains,Verónica H. Villena,21 April 2020,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1088,"AbstractCarbon transparency, once a niche practice, is increasingly becoming institutionalized. Firms are now required to report not only their operations' carbon emissions but also their suppliers'. This research explores the institutional pressures emanating from buyers and industry peers driving supplier firms to disclose high-quality carbon emission publicly—our concept of carbon transparency. Many firms are increasingly adopting incentives to engage their employees in corporate climate change programs. Thus, we study the impact of three institutional pressures—coercive,mimetic, andnormative—and examine when these pressures are more (or less) effective for driving supplier carbon transparency depending on the presence of climate change incentives. We used Carbon Disclosure Project's supply chain program (CDP-SCP) as our research context. To gain deeper insight into the CDP-SCP as well as the drivers and challenges of suppliers' carbon transparency, we conducted interviews with three CDP officials, three CDP-SCP members (i.e., buyers), and six CDP-SCP participants (i.e., suppliers). To test our hypotheses, we used a unique dataset from CDP-SCP and complemented it with four other archival datasets for a sample of 835 suppliers operating in 41 countries during the 2013–2015 period. The results show that supplierswithoutclimate change incentives are more vulnerable to coercive and mimetic pressures, whereas supplierswithclimate change incentives are more receptive to normative pressure in terms of how much carbon transparency they exhibit. Thus, our study proposes an extensive concept of supplier carbon transparency, provides a comprehensive analysis of its external/internal drivers, and reveals when institutional pressures are more/less effective in eliciting supplier carbon transparency. This research also provides strategies for how buyers, suppliers, and CDP can foster more carbon transparency in supply chains."
"Value first, cost later: Total value contribution as a new approach to sourcing decisions",John V. Gray,20 September 2020,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1113,"AbstractFirms compete on value, not cost alone. However, sourcing decisions are often heavily weighted towards minimizing costs, even though these decisions also can affect revenue, risk, and other stakeholder values. To address this disconnect, we introduce a new approach to strategic sourcing, “total value contribution” (TVC). The TVC name by itself promotes attention to value. TVC's structured approach begins with the question: “what do our customers, current and future, value about our products?” The TVC approach builds on insights from the literature on individual and group decision-making to offset human biases and organizational incentives that emphasize cost reduction. TVC builds on gains already achieved by “total cost of ownership” (TCO) sourcing methods, which broadened the list of factors considered in sourcing. We provide examples of TVC-like thinking in real organizations and argue that such thinking would be more common with the dissemination of TVC. We also provide access to a version of this JOM Forum piece suitable to assign to students, and discuss a new teaching note which describes how to implement TVC in a popular strategic sourcing teaching case. We believe widespread implementation of TVC would improve both organizational and social outcomes."

Optimizing stock-keeping unit selection for promotional display space at grocery retailers,Olga Pak,17 December 2019,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1075,"AbstractPromotional displays, such as end-of-aisle displays, provide a stimulus for discretionary and incremental sales at grocery stores, offering a powerful yet affordable tool to boost profit. In this study, we examine a store manager's choice of which stock-keeping units (SKUs) from a given category to assign to a promotional display space. While the academic literature and retail software solution providers offer a variety of optimization solutions for the assortment optimization problem, there is very little guidance for retailers on how to optimally determine when and what products to place on their promotional display space. Consequently, retailers often default to simple heuristics, which are typically suboptimal from a profit maximization standpoint, when making this decision. Thus, there is a need for a decision support tool to facilitate the product selection for promotional display space. Using a grocery store sales transaction data set, we demonstrate how to measure the incremental lift in sales of placing a particular SKU on promotional display space. Our optimization model includes the incremental lifts (from the estimation method) combined with the estimated base-sales rates and profit margins of each SKU so that the profit-maximizing SKU can be chosen for a promotional display space for each week of the year. Placing a SKU on promotional display can result in a significant lift in sales. For example, the estimated average display effect (i.e., sales lift) for the beer category across all SKUs and all weeks is 27%, which makes promotional display a very effective tool for stimulating incremental product sales. Overall, our methodology results in at least 1.6 times improvement in incremental profit when compared to a common industry benchmark. We also test our methodology on two additional product categories and demonstrate that it performs equally well across product categories. Our work provides an easy-to-implement, promotional display SKU-selection methodology that includes both an estimation and an optimization model. Our estimation model can handle an extensive and complex product assortment and accounts for important aspects of promotional activities such as the cannibalization of the inner aisle sales and halo effects. Our optimization model is flexible enough to consider practical aspects such as common business rules that restrict the selection of the same SKU over a consecutive set of weeks, display-related changeover costs, and slotting fees offered by the manufacturers. Overall, our study underscores the importance of making effective promotional display decisions."
The impact of disclosing inventory-scarcity messages on sales in online retailing,Sungho Park,18 February 2020,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1082,"AbstractTo influence demand, some online retailers post messages (e.g., “5 units or less left in stock”) on their product pages to signal impending stockouts. These “scarcity” messages provide consumers “partial” inventory information, revealing only an upper bound on the number of units available for sale. To examine the impact of these messages, we obtained price and sales data from an online-retailer website across a sample of durable goods before and after the retailer posted the messages over multiple inventory-replenishment cycles. We then used these data to assess empirically the effect of these messages on these products' daily sales. We find that disclosing these messages can decrease daily sales by an average of 17.60%. This finding suggests that scarcity messages such as these can have a negative influence on the sales prospects of durable goods. We also observe, on the other hand, that price discounts are quite effective in increasing sales and offsetting the losses induced by scarcity messages. On average, a reduction of 1% in stock keeping unit price increases daily sales by approximately 3%. Therefore, relative to disclosing scarcity messages, price discounts are a much more effective tool at increasing inventory turns."
Improving customer routing in contact centers: An automated triage design based on text analytics,Noyan Ilk,05 March 2020,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1084,"AbstractWe propose an automated triage design for intelligent customer routing in live-chat contact centers and demonstrate its implementation using a real-world data set from an S&P 500 firm. The proposed design emerges as a synthesis of text analytics and predictive machine learning methods. Using numerical experiments based on the simulation of the firm's contact center, we demonstrate the service level, time, and labor cost benefits of the automated design over two other triage designs (i.e., customer choice triage and human expert triage) that are commonly employed in the real world. Through additional analyses, we explore the generalizability of the automated design for creating solutions for different types of communication channels. Our work has implications for managing customer relations under emerging communication technologies (e.g., live-chat, e-mail, and social media) and more broadly for demonstrating the use of text analytics and machine learning to improve Operations Management practice."
Buyer participation in outsourced new product development projects: The role of relationship multiplexity,Johanna H. Slot,12 March 2020,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1085,"AbstractIn business markets, firms increasingly participate in new product development (NPD) activities that they outsource to suppliers. Such buyer participation can be complicated by relationship multiplexity—that is, the buyer may simultaneously be a competitor, supplier, and/or partner of the supplier firm. Drawing on role theory, we theorize how relationship multiplexity moderates the effect of buyer participation on project success. We analyze 140 NPD projects that were executed by a contract R&D organization in the aerospace industry and find that buyer participation lowers the buyer's and the supplier's perceptions of project success for buyer-as-supplier multiplexity. Buyer participation increases the perceptions of project success in the case of buyer-as-partner multiplexity, but only when these partnerships are emergent, as opposed to engineered. Buyer participation decreases the buyer's perception of project success for relationships featuring buyer-as-competitor multiplexity but does not affect the supplier's perception in the case of buyer-as-competitor multiplexity. Our results provide tactical insights as to when buyer participation helps or hurts."

The role of operational expenditures and misalignments in fundraising for international humanitarian aid,Laura Turrini,13 December 2019,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1072,"AbstractFunding for international humanitarian aid falls far behind demand for disaster response, hampering the operations of international humanitarian organizations (IHOs). One remedy to close this gap is to increase the effectiveness of fundraising activities for IHOs. This remedy means spending as little as possible in fundraising activities but, at the same time, still receiving sufficient donations to implement disaster response programs in response to the needs that arise when disasters occur. We contribute to the literature by theoretically developing and estimating a conceptual framework that links donation behavior to the operations that IHOs aim to pursue; the framework incorporates operational costs communicated in appeals, fundraising efforts, and media attention. We argue that effects are not homogenous across disasters but that IHOs can leverage public attention and disaster and appeal characteristics, such as operational costs, to increase donations. We test the framework on a unique data set for disaster response programs operated by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), covering 174 disasters to which the IFRC responded between 2010 and 2017."
Impact of customers' digital banking adoption on hidden defection: A combined analytical–empirical approach,Yoonseock Son,15 November 2019,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1066,"AbstractThe implementation of digital channels as avenues for economic transactions (e.g., online and mobile banking/FinTech) has shifted the paradigm of customer–bank interactions, providing unprecedented opportunities for both parties. The prevailing belief is that digital banking has several advantages, such as lower costs and higher information transferability for customers. These benefits can also promote competition between banks given customers' predilection for “multi-homing,” or engagement with multiple banks. This study investigated the impact of customers' digital banking adoption on hidden defection, in which customers purchase financial products from competing banks instead of their primary banks. To this end, we developed an analytical model to provide insights into the effects of digital banking adoption while taking customers' multi-homing behaviors into consideration. We then conducted a series of empirical analyses using comprehensive individual-level transaction data to provide evidence of hidden defection. Our findings indicate that customers with higher loyalty exhibit greater hidden defection after digital banking adoption. Customers who engage primarily with personal-service channels (e.g., branches) show stronger hidden defection than do self-service channel (e.g., ATMs) users, and this effect is more prevalent among loyal customers. Our results provide valuable implications for omni-channel services in a market characterized by multi-homing behavior of customers."
The effect of failure on performance over time: The case of cardiac surgery operations,Emmanouil Avgerinos,11 November 2019,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1068,"AbstractFailure is a common occurrence in many operational contexts involving knowledge work. Concentrating on highly critical cardiac surgery operations, we investigate how failure affects subsequent performance over time. In addressing our research questions, we draw on the sensemaking perspective and incorporate behavioral aspects of failure that are often overlooked. We develop three hypotheses on the effects of failure (i.e., in-hospital mortality of a patient) and test them with a unique data set of 4,306 cardiac surgery operations from a large European hospital, spanning five years. Our findings show that while failure promotes learning over time and improves task execution quality (as measured by patients' reduced length of stay) in the long term, its effect is the opposite in the short term. Our work also unravels how relational dynamics (i.e., familiarity) may reduce the short-term effects of failure. We find evidence that team familiarity mitigates the detrimental effects of recent failures. This implies that certain team assignment strategies after failure (e.g., putting individuals into familiar teams) may be preferable than others. We explore and illustrate this by conducting a policy simulation based on our data. This article provides new insights into how operations managers can support their employees in moving forward after failure."
When do appointments of corporate sustainability executives affect shareholder value?,Priyank Arora,08 December 2019,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1074,"AbstractOver the last two decades, firms have been appointing corporate sustainability executives (CSEs) to be part of their top management teams. Although there is a vast literature on sustainable practices and their relationships with various measures of firm performance, little is known about the nature of the empirical link between CSE appointments and financial performance. We add to the understanding of this link by estimating the stock market reactions to a sample of 115 announcements of CSE appointments made by firms during the period 2000–2018. Our findings using event study methodology, followed by regression analyses, suggest that although the stock market reaction to CSE appointments is not significantly different from zero, the stock market reacts more, or less positively under certain firm- and industry-specific conditions. We find that the stock market reaction is more positive in instances where the announcing firms faced a prior adverse sustainability-related incident, and less positive for announcing firms that operate in industries that face relatively higher levels of regulatory sanctions. Also, we find that the stock market reaction is more positive when firms announce CSE appointments with focused as compared to broad responsibilities. Additionally, we find that CSE appointments are associated with subsequent improvements in operating performance—partly driven by a decrease in total costs and partly by an increase in sales. Overall, our findings support the strategy of appointing CSEs to top management teams and enable executives and stakeholders to more deeply understand the shareholder value and operating performance effects of appointing CSEs."
Managing uncertain tasks in technology-intensive project environments: A multi-method study of task closure and capacity management decisions,Sriram Narayanan,20 November 2019,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1062,"AbstractEngineers working on tasks in technology-intensive project environments face substantial task resolution uncertainty. This can result in poor capacity utilization as they expend effort on tasks that are not successfully resolved. A deeper understanding of task-related uncertainty can help the firm optimize effort allocation across tasks by implementing well-designed task closure policies that facilitate superior capacity utilization and capacity planning. In this article, we characterize the empirical distribution of task uncertainty and demonstrate how the resolution process affects task outcomes in project environments. Using a combination of empirical estimation, and analytical and simulation modeling, we develop insights into task-related decision-making and engineer effort allocation. Using real-world task resolution data from a software maintenance setting, we first model and estimate a beta-geometric survival distribution which indicates that the likelihood of successful task resolution substantially reduces with the time a task remains in the system. Using analytical and simulation modeling, we then examine the implications of imposing task closure policies to improve engineer effort allocation and increase system productivity. We demonstrate that adopting well-designed task closure policies can significantly improve engineer resource utilization in capacity-constrained settings without a substantial negative impact on project outcomes. We discuss the implications of our research for theory and practice."
Sourcing structures and the execution efficiency of information technology projects: A comparative evaluation using stochastic frontier analysis,Anant Mishra,02 December 2019,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1064,"AbstractIn the pursuit of low-wage labor and access to technical talent, information technology (IT) projects today are often executed with sourcing structures that span the boundaries of a firm, a country, or both. Although the strategic implications of sourcing structures have received considerable attention in theory and practice, their implications from a project execution standpoint—specifically, in terms of execution efficiency—remain under-researched. Based on a large primary dataset on IT projects with distributed sourcing structures, this paper documents the findings of a theoretically grounded, empirical investigation using stochastic frontier analysis that evaluates whether and to what extent does the execution efficiency of projects vary across various types of sourcing structures (namely,Domestic-Insourcing,Domestic-Outsourcing,Offshore-Insourcing, andOffshore-Outsourcing). The results provide support for differential effects of crossing a firm or country boundary, or both boundaries, on the execution efficiency of IT projects. Specifically, we find that the execution efficiency of IT projects is significantly lower when their sourcing structures cross a country boundary (Offshore-InsourcingandOffshore-Outsourcing) relative to when their sourcing structures do not cross a country boundary (Domestic-InsourcingandDomestic-Outsourcing). Notwithstanding these trends across sourcing structures, a split-sample analysis of execution efficiency levels reveals that each structure presents a viable alternative for managers to realize high levels of execution efficiency. Finally, additional analysis highlights the benefits of sourcing structure capabilities—as represented by the extent ofrisk management planningandagile project management—in improving execution efficiency in IT projects that cross a country boundary."
From efficiency-driven to low-carbon operations management: Implications for labor productivity,Antonio Sartal,09 October 2019,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1060,"AbstractWe use 9 years of dynamic panel data (4,090 observations) to explore how decarbonization moderates the association between a selection of efficiency-driven shop-floor initiatives and labor productivity. The results are mixed: the relationship between materials efficiency and labor productivity is positively moderated by decarbonization, but the relationship between increases in inventory turnover or the average firm wage as a multiple of average sector wages are negatively moderated by decarbonization. Overall, we find that decarbonization leads to an average drop in sales of 1.8% per worker. This evidence therefore suggests that climate change goals impacting industrial firms might be difficult to accomplish if managers expect to achieve decarbonization for free with current organizational best practices."
Using transactions data to improve consumer returns forecasting,Guangzhi Shang,01 December 2019,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1071,"AbstractAlthough generous return policies have been shown to have marketing benefits, such as a higher willingness to pay and a higher purchase frequency, counterbalancing these benefits is an increased volume of consumer returns, which presents significant operational challenges for both retailers and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). Since accurate return forecasts are inputs into strategic and tactic decision support tools for operations managers, advancements in better forecast accuracy can yield significant savings from the returns management practice. We propose a forecasting approach that incorporates transaction-level data, such as purchase and return timestamps, and predicts future return quantities using a two-step “predict-aggregate” process. To enhance the generalizability of our framework, we test it on two distinct datasets provided by a bricks-and-mortar electronics retailer and an online jewelry retailer. We find that our approach demonstrates significant forecasting error reduction, in the range of 10–20%, over benchmark models constructed from common industry practices and the existing literature. As our approach leverages the same data inputs as existing models, it can be easily adapted by practitioners. We also consider a number of extensions to generalize our approach into contexts such as restricted return time windows, new product returns, and inflated same-day returns. Last, we discuss broad implications of return forecast accuracy improvements in the areas such as inventory management, staffing level, reverse logistics, and return recovery decisions."
Looking at ourselves: Lessons about the operations management field learned from our top journals,Sunil Babbar,29 January 2020,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1081,"AbstractWe focus here on questions regarding the craft of producing operations management (OM) research manuscripts. Are the journals we publish in too siloed, with regard to participating authors and institutions? Likewise, are the OM departments we work in too intellectually siloed by virtue of journal choice—are there too many like minds? In light of who publishes in our journals and who we coauthor with, is our field “global enough” or is North America weighing too heavily? We also strive to answer a question faced by many OM departments: should highly published faculty be hired from other schools? How do such highly published authors influence those around them? We arrive at partial answers to these questions by exploring an extensive history of publication data from four journals:Journal of Operations Management,Production and Operations Management,Manufacturing and Service Operations Management, andManagement Science."

The value of process friction: The role of justification in reducing medical costs,Jillian A. Berry Jaeker,01 April 2019,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1024,"AbstractWe study the role of process friction in increasing efficiency of service provisions. We examine one potential lever for reducing the provision of discretionary services: “justification”—an otherwise non-value-added process step that introduces process friction by forcing workers to explain the rationale for requesting an optional service. We exploit the presence—and absence—of a justification step in the ultrasound (US) ordering process at two emergency departments (EDs). We find that patients with abdominal pain are less than half as likely to receive an US when there is a justification step compared to when there is not. Additionally, we find a spillover effect: other diagnostic tests are also ordered less frequently. The decrease in testing reduces the average length of stay of the patients, and reduces testing costs by more than $200,000, with no decrease in quality. We show that two mechanisms underlie these results: (a) justificationreduces clinicians' available time, and (b) justification forces clinicians toreflecton a patient's need for service. Our paper contributes to recent theory on friction and reflection as drivers of efficiency in services. We show that justification can serve as an effective lever for reducing medical tests—and costs—without negatively impacting quality."
Temporal pacing of outcomes for improving patient flow: Design science research in a National Health Service hospital,Mark Johnson,27 December 2019,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1077,"AbstractImproving patient flow in hospitals is a contemporary challenge in the UK National Health Service (NHS). When patients remain in a hospital bed for longer than clinically necessary, hospital performance is dramatically impacted, quality of care is reduced, and elective surgeries are cancelled at great cost to both hospital and patient. This research explains how one UK hospital employed design science research to improve patient flow after other process improvement techniques had failed. The work focused on improving patient flow through the creation of a set of interconnected, temporally paced routines that successfully engaged doctors and nurses in new, outcome-specific ways of working. These routines were both independent and interdependent, were relationally coordinated through time, and systematically and unambiguously engaged all levels of staff at specific temporal junctures. We discover that the successful adoption of these routines was cumulative rather than iterative and was aligned with ongoing efforts supporting the social aspects of change. Through this work, our case hospital saw performance improvements that moved them from being below average to the best in the country, combining improvements in patient care with savings of over £3 million in the first 12 months. The contribution of this research is twofold; first, we explain how the development of outcome-specific routines can facilitate process improvement, and second, we illustrate how design science research can successfully bridge theory and practice to promote swift and even flow in healthcare."
Emergency department resilience to disaster-level overcrowding: A component resilience framework for analysis and predictive modeling,Zachary Davis,05 April 2019,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1017,"AbstractOvercrowding poses a serious challenge to the operations of health care facilities, especially those with a mandate to provide emergency care. A better understanding of emergency department (ED) performance during disaster-level overcrowding is a key to increasing a facility's resilience, optimizing patient outcomes, and more effectively allocating resources. With this in mind, this study quantitatively examines the extent to which different factors contribute to the resilience of hospital EDs during disaster-level overcrowding events. A modeling framework was developed in collaboration with the Carilion Clinic ED, a level one trauma center in Virginia. The testing and analysis of the approach is based on data from actual disaster-level overcrowding events that occurred in the Spring of 2016. Results indicate that by considering not only the capacity for resisting such events but also the capacity for recovering from them more quickly, hospital decision makers can improve both their operational effectiveness and the patient experience. Furthermore, by using our framework to identify precipitating factors and predict severe overcrowding, hospital decision makers can implement changes to improve the future resilience of their ED to such overcrowding events."
When do workarounds help or hurt patient outcomes? The moderating role of operational failures,Anita L. Tucker,26 March 2019,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1015,"AbstractHospital providers often use workarounds to circumvent processes so that patients can receive care. Workarounds in response to operational failures enable care to continue and therefore may be indicative of workers' commitment. On the other hand, workarounds in the absence of operational failures may signal an ineffective approach associated with lower quality of care and worse patient outcomes. Working closely with healthcare providers, we developed a survey to measure workaround behaviors and operational failures on medical/surgical units. The lead author surveyed over 4,000 nurses from 63 hospitals throughout the United States. We matched this data with audit data on the incidence of pressure injuries among over 21,000 patients on 262 nursing units in 56 survey hospitals. Hospital-acquired pressure injuries are a significant risk to patient health and hospital costs. We do not find support for our hypothesis that workarounds are associated with a higher rate of hospital-acquired pressure injuries. However, when we take into account the moderating role of operational failures on the relationship between workarounds and pressure injuries, we find significant results. When nursing units have lower levels of operational failures, workarounds are associated with higher rates of hospital-acquired pressure injuries. Our results provide evidence that workarounds may be associated with negative patient outcomes, if they stem from a process-avoiding approach. The best results can be achieved by reducing both operational failures and workarounds via instilling a process-focused approach."
The impact of planning and communication on unplanned costs in surgical episodes of care: Implications for reducing waste in hospital operating rooms,David Dreyfus,28 November 2019,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1070,"AbstractThis ethnographic study of more than 90 surgeries (referred to as episodes of care) identifies the antecedents to operating room (OR) supply waste. The study specifically considers the role of planning instances and communication patterns among members of the surgery team on supply waste within the OR. We operationalize planning instances in terms of the number of changes to the physician preference card (PPC), the key document that is used to plan items needed for surgery. Communication patterns among members of the surgery team are captured by measuring the density of communication among the OR team members during an episode of care. The unplanned costs during an episode of care are used as a measure of OR supply waste. Hundreds of hours were spent observing episodes of care and tracking supplies. A combination of participant-observation, survey, and secondary data were analyzed to extract theoretical and practical insights. The results show that planning instances have a curvilinear relationship with unplanned costs. In particular, as the number of changes to the PPC increases, unplanned costs first increase and then decrease. Higher density of the OR team's communication network is associated with lower unplanned costs. This study has significant theoretical and managerial implications that we discuss and offer directions for future research."
Implementing new technologies for complex care: The role of embeddedness factors in team learning,Merieke Stevens,10 June 2019,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1034,"AbstractBearing the rising health care costs of our aging global population is one of the most urgent challenges society is facing. We study the implementation of new medical technologies as one way to increase the effectiveness of care, particularly in the area of aortic disease—a condition that affects an increasing number of patients globally. Our research focus is the implementation of complex endovascular treatment techniques by a multidisciplinary aortic treatment group, in addition to their traditional open treatment of aortic disease. We find that relational and cognitive embeddedness factors support team learning, which in turn enables the team to achieve its self-set goals of treating more patients; offering more tailor-made care; and providing endovascular treatment in emergency situations. At the end of our data collection period, the first steps toward the team's ultimate goal of offering patient-centered care were also taken."
On the tension between standardized and customized policies in health care: The case of length-of-stay reduction,Rodolfo Catena,22 April 2019,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1016,"AbstractHospitals increasingly adopt standardized policies as a way to improve the efficiency of health care delivery. One key policy has been to reduce a patient's length of stay, which is commonly perceived as an effective means of improving patient outcome, as well as reducing the cost per procedure. We put this notion to the empirical test by using a database of 183,712,784 medical records of patients in the English NHS between 1998 and 2012, studying the effects of the NHS's policy of decreasing length of stay for hernia patients. While we found it to be an effective way of reducing the cost per procedure, on aggregate, we also found that it increases the risk of readmission and of death for vulnerable and elderly patients, unduly increasing the long-term failure costs of the operation for these patient groups. Based on our findings, we propose a differentiated policy to selectively decrease length of stay, which we estimate could save up to US$565 per nonemergency hernia procedure (19.97% reduction in the cost per procedure). We outline the implications of our findings for medical practice and discuss the wider theoretical contributions to the wider standardization-customization debate in health care operations management."
Impact of the value-based purchasing program on hospital operations outcomes: An econometric analysis,Seung Jun Lee,16 September 2019,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1057,"AbstractThe Hospital Value-Based Purchasing (VBP) Program, one of several federal regulations mandated by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, uses Medicare provider payment penalties and bonuses to encourage hospital administrators to improve performance in four domains: clinical processes, patient outcomes, patient experiences, and efficiency. Before VBP's launch, some practitioners claimed VBP would have little impact, while others feared well-off hospitals would be unfairly rewarded at the expense of previously poor-performing hospitals. We examine whether and how the VBP penalties affect aggregate operating outcomes of healthcare providers in hospitals. Using secondary data, we find empirical evidence that hospitals with prior-year VBP penalties exhibit positive associations between the penalty magnitude and certain current-year care process improvements. Over the prior year, penalized hospitals also tend to exhibit increased patient case mix metrics, which should enhance revenue as a spillover effect. In a post hoc analysis, we observe that bonus-receiving hospitals are less apt to exhibit subsequent performance improvements for these same metrics. Our contributions result from theoretically framing differences in hospital operating activities when facing the VBP Program's penalties as well as empirically demonstrating consequences of the penalty's magnitude."
"Service mix, market competition, and cost efficiency: A longitudinal study of U.S. hospitals",Xin (David) Ding,09 July 2019,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1050,"AbstractWe examine the longitudinal impact of service mix on cost efficiency in U.S. acute care general hospitals. We propose two different dimensions of service mix, with the first dimension capturing internal emphasis on specific service lines (i.e., specialization) and the second dimension reflecting the deviation of a hospital from the average level of specialization for hospitals in the same service area (i.e., differentiation). We hypothesize that as the level of a hospital's specialization increases, hospital cost efficiency should improve at a decreasing rate. We also hypothesize that differentiation helps improve cost efficiency in competitive markets. Lastly, we examine whether acute care general hospitals can use service mix as an operational lever to improve cost efficiency when specialty hospitals are present in the same local markets. We find strong empirical support for the hypothesized relationships."
Patient care effectiveness and financial outcomes of hospital physician contracting emphasis,Saurabh Mishra,04 July 2019,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1048,"AbstractThis study investigates the influence of hospitals' physician contracting emphasis on patient care effectiveness and financial outcomes. It utilizes secondary data for a comprehensive set of hospitals in the United States over a 21-year period (1996–2016). Analysis confirms that hospitals with a greater emphasis on physician contracting have higher operating margins but also tend to have longer patient length of stay—indicating lower patient care effectiveness. Lower patient care effectiveness, in turn, is observed to attenuate some of the financial gains from physician contracting. Further, post hoc analysis with other measures of patient care, including experiential quality, conformance quality, readmissions, and mortality provide additional insights into the effect of physician contracting on patient care. Theory and results also highlight teaching intensity and capacity utilization of hospitals as key boundary conditions in these relationships, revealing a complex set of findings related to these variables. Together, the findings yield practical insights for hospital managers regarding their operations strategy."
Robot-assisted surgical care delivery at a hospital: Policies for maximizing clinical outcome benefits and minimizing costs,Ujjal K. Mukherjee,04 November 2019,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1058,"AbstractRobot-assisted surgery is a major advancement in minimally invasive surgical care delivery. It allows surgeons to gain additional dexterity, improved precision in surgical tasks, enhanced three-dimensional vision of the surgical field, and superior accessibility to the surgical field. Notwithstanding the clinical outcome benefits (such as reduced blood loss and surgical duration, and shorter length-of-stay at a hospital), the cost of performing robot-assisted surgery is significantly high, due to the investments needed for robot acquisition, maintenance, and procurement of surgical accessories. In this study, we address the twin objectives of a hospital where robot-assisted surgery is performed: maximize the clinical outcome benefits and minimize the total cost of robot-assisted surgery. The surgical robot that is the focus of the study is ada Vincisurgical system. The surgical procedure that serves as the context of this study is hysterectomy. We demonstrate the application of an integrated methodological approach—combining empirical analysis involving an on-site, prospective investigation at a hospital and retrospective analysis of archival data from the hospital for robustness checks, analytical modeling, and discrete event simulation—to identify and analyze actionable policies that a hospital can implement. The specific policies we analyze are related to: (a)patient triagingfor robot-assisted surgery based on the criticality of disease condition of a patient; (b) the optimalsize of surgeon poolto facilitate the development of surgeon experience and learning; and (c) theminimum experience levelof a surgeon with a robot needed to be included in the surgeon pool for robot-assisted surgery. The key contributions of this article are in demonstrating the following: First, hospital-level policies can help to realize both the clinical outcome and cost benefits of a surgical robot. Second, the criticality of patient condition is a significant determinant of surgeon learning in robot-assisted surgery. Third, application of the proposed integrated methodological approach can yield nuanced and actionable insights into an operational setting where data availability is limited and generalizability of study insights is a concern, as is the case in this study."

Exploring the performance implications of precarious work,Frank Wiengarten,12 July 2021,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1155,"AbstractPrecarious work, or employment that is associated with temporary contracts, low earnings and limited or no employee representation, is on the rise. From an operations perspective, these practices should enable flexibility and reduce costs. However, from the perspective of most other social sciences, precarious work harms workers and should harm firm performance. The objective of this research is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the performance implications of precarious work. We collected survey data in the UK from multiple respondents (operations and human resource managers) along with secondary data to explore how the use of precarious work affects a company's financial, operational and occupational health & safety performance. The results were mixed. Precarious work did not have a significant influence on occupational health & safety performance and had a negative relationship with cost performance. We also established an inverted u-shaped relationship between precarious work and flexibility and financial performance; low levels of precarious work improve flexibility and financial performance and high levels of precarious work harm both. Finally, we explored if high-performance work practices could moderate these relationships, but the results were mostly insignificant. The results suggest that firms only benefit from relatively low levels of adoption of precarious work."
A behavioral perspective on service center routing: The role of inertia,Aaron Schecter,08 August 2021,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1156,"AbstractResearch on service center routing has largely assumed either fully codified automated routing, rational routing agents who can optimally route calls, or both. In practice, however, many routing scenarios are not fully codifiable, and human routing agents will likely exhibit biases in their routing decisions. In this paper, we explore the presence of behavioral inertia in service center routing. Inertia in this context is the propensity for routing agents to route issues more frequently to other agents with whom they have experience, rather than optimally routing those issues. We leveraged a unique dataset of more than 70,000 routing decisions in a complex service operations context to examine the presence of inertia and associated performance implications. We find that, overall, inertia hurts performance, but in certain situations can be beneficial. Inertia increases the probability of issue resolution when agents exhibit inertial behavior in routing to other agents with high expertise, and inertia positively impacts (decreases) service time for particularly difficult, complex customer issues. This study contributes to research in service center operations by studying a previously unexplored phenomenon of inertia in routing by human agents and provides valuable insights to practitioners who manage service centers."
The role of psychological distance in organizational responses to modern slavery risk in supply chains,Dayna Simpson,24 September 2021,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1157,"AbstractModern slavery is used to describe forms of coercive labor exploitation that affect more than 40 million persons globally. Such practices are difficult to identify given they exist in the informal economy, and involve vulnerable individuals. Addressing modern slavery by organizations requires awareness of its context and complexities. While corporations have increasingly sought to manage modern slavery risk in their supply chains, their understanding of what modern slavery is and what should be managed remains limited. We argue a key problem with firms’ efforts to manage modern slavery risk is that it is a psychologically distant concept for them. We apply construal level theory to explore how organizations’ psychological distance from modern slavery risk affects their management of risk. We interviewed purchasing executives at 41 global organizations in Australia, Finland, and the U.S and identified four approaches to managing modern slavery risk at different levels of psychological distance. We also identified that conflicts between organizations' approaches to risk and what they identify in their operating environment, precedes important construal shifts that help to improve organizational understanding of labor-related risk. We highlight ways that organizations' understanding of modern slavery risk plays a role in their governance of such risk in supply chains."

The association between supply chain structure and transparency: A large-scale empirical study,Jury Gualandris,14 June 2021,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1150,"AbstractAn emerging body of work acknowledges the challenges focal firms face in gathering material information about their extended supply chains and begins to point to the role of supply chain structure in influencing supply chain transparency. Still, large-scale empirical evidence on this complex association remains elusive, especially at the supply chain level of analysis. We begin to bridge this empirical gap by examining whether supply chain structure systematically associates to supply chain transparency in the context of the collective public environmental, social, and governance (ESG) disclosures made by a focal firm's customers, suppliers, and subsuppliers. To shed light on this underexplored empirical phenomenon, we gather Bloomberg SPLC data and Bloomberg ESG data about 4803 firms and 20,504 contractual ties organized in 187 extended supply chains. We find that supply chain density positively associates with supply chain transparency, whereas supply chain clustering holds a negative association. We also find that supply chain geographical heterogeneity positively associates with supply chain transparency. Our results significantly expand the literature on supply chain transparency and are relevant to supply chain professionals because they emphasize the central role of supply chain structure in enabling or constraining supply chain transparency."
Cross-item learning for volatile demand forecasting: An intervention with predictive analytics,Howard Hao-Chun Chuang,16 June 2021,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1152,"AbstractDespite its importance to OM, demand forecasting has been perceived as a “problem-solving” exercise; most empirical work in the field has focused on explanatory models but neglected prediction problems that are part of empirical science. The present study, involving one of the leading electronics distributors in the world, aims to improve prediction accuracy under high demand volatility for procurement managers to make better inventory decisions. In response to requests for an integrated forecasting methodology, we undertook an iterative process based on three guiding principles—data pooling,theory-informed feature engineering, andensemble-based machine learning. The resulting framework managed to improve forecast accuracy significantly and is applicable to a broad range of situations. We present reflections and insights derived abductively through engagement with managers in this problem situation. This “problem-driven” process corresponds to intervention as a research strategy that can foster theoretical and methodological innovations in OM. Our contribution goes beyond the development of the prediction framework as it elucidates ways OM researchers could leverage theoretical foundations to inform feature derivation and model construction. We posit that this work points to a way forward to the combination of OM principles with the emerging innovations in data science and artificial intelligence."
Towards a theory of informal supply networks: An exploratory case study of the Za'atari refugee camp,Ismail Abushaikha,08 June 2021,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1151,"AbstractStudies of humanitarian supply chain operations contribute to efficient system designs for the delivery of goods and services to disaster- and conflict-stricken regions. However, our understanding of what happens to these relief goods and services after they are delivered is quite limited. Using a case study of the Za'atari refugee camp in Jordan, we develop a theory ofinformal supply networks, whereby we uncover how refugee-led, informal supply networks emerge in the camp. We find that these supply networks are an aggregate of predominantly illicit—yet legitimate—channels and social relationships that support the economic exchange of goods and services between distinct actors or actor groups. We not only identify the cultural conventions and behavioral codes that govern ties between refugees—and between refugees and relief-related actors—but also define how these networks are configured. Considering these findings, we contend that the informal economic activities emanating from the refugee camp benefit the host community and enhance the resilience of the informal supply networks. As informal economic activities also improve the quality of life in the camp, camp authorities and host country governments should attend to informal activities as they create rules and policies for refugee resettlement."
To err is human: Exploratory multilevel analysis of supply chain delivery delays,Amrou Awaysheh,22 July 2021,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1154,"ABSTRACTWe examine the impact of human errors by front-line supply chain employees on delivery delays. We build on normal accident theory (NAT), a multilevel theory describing the relationship between a firm's latent conditions (systemic managerial, technology, and social factors) and human errors. Latent conditions can have the unintended consequence of intensifying the impact of a human error, thus, we hypothesize a moderating effect of latent conditions on the relationship between errors and delivery delays. Hypotheses are tested using archival shipment data provided by a Fortune 500 company and archival carrier violations data. A multilevel design, with 299,399 shipments (level 1) nested within 97 carriers (level 2), was tested using mixed effects regression modeling. The results indicated that both dispatcher and driver errors were related to the probability of a late delivery, and that dispatcher errors were associated with longer delays. The moderating effects of several carrier latent conditions were significant and positive, indicating that both types of errors were more strongly associated with the likelihood of late delivery and that dispatcher errors were associated with longer delays when moderated by carrier latent conditions. The results are discussed from the perspective of NAT and technology management, developing prescriptions, and suggesting opportunities for future research."
Performance and survival implications of sourcing choice sequence across an architectural innovation life cycle,Woo-Yong Park,28 January 2021,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1134,"AbstractThis study investigates follower firms' make–buy sourcing choices and sequences in response to an architectural innovation by an innovator. We argue that the dynamic trade-offs among knowledge acquisition, knowledge transformation, and transaction cost reduction underlie the performance impacts of make–buy sourcing choices and sequences across the architectural innovation life cycle. Using the data gathered from the gear-shifting market of the U.S. bicycle industry, we empirically demonstrate that “buy” is a superior sourcing choice before key market-winner features (i.e., dominant design) have emerged. After that, “make” becomes a superior choice. We then demonstrate that the “buy-to-make” sourcing sequence is associated with superior technological and financial performances in the postdominant design phase of the architectural innovation period, as well as with greater firm survival during the market shakeout in the later period of modular standardization.

Innovation in complex assembled electronic products: An analysis of the evolution of television components,Shivendu Pratap Singh,03 May 2021,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1139,"AbstractA complex assembled electronic product (CAEP), such as a modern television (TV), can be produced in a variety of design configurations using different combinations of software and hardware components that are arranged together in a hierarchy of technical subsystems within a defined product architecture. We examine the lifecycle of individual components that make up a CAEP to better understand why its dominant design configuration includes specific components from among the (often many) competing alternatives. The emergence of the dominant design configuration of a product has long-term implications on the operational efficiency of a firm's product assembly line and its component selection strategy. We test hypotheses that explain both the inclusion of a component in the dominant design configuration of a CAEP, and its longevity to remain in the product market over the lifecycle of the CAEP using three key factors: (a)pleiotropy, or the number of functions supported by the component, (b) the nature of standards used by the component (openvs.closed), and (c) the source of innovation of the component (exogenousvs.endogenousto the industry). We empirically test our hypotheses using a longitudinal data set of 2830 TV models spanning 15 years (2002–2016). The results show that components that have higher pleiotropy and that are supported by open standards not only have a higher chance of being selected into the dominant design configuration of TV, but also remain in the TV market for a longer time. Specifically, every additional functionality associated with a component increases its likelihood of entering the dominant design configuration by approximately three times, and its longevity by about 2 years. Similarly, a component supported by an open standard is approximately four times more likely to be part of the dominant design configuration compared with a component supported by a closed standard, and it remains in the TV market for approximately an additional 2 years. In addition, components developed through endogenous innovation efforts were nearly five times more likely to enter the dominant design configuration of TV. Their longevity, however, was not significantly different from that of components sourced exogenously. Building on these results, we discuss the implications for product management of CAEP and for further research to examine innovation in CAEPs."
"Introducing goods innovation, service innovation, or both? Investigating the tension in managing innovation revenue streams for manufacturing and service firms",Adrian Choo,18 March 2021,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1136,"AbstractMany manufacturing and service companies extend their product lines by pursuingdifferentdomain NPI (new product introduction), that is, manufacturers launching new services and service firms venturing into new goods. Little is known about how this innovation approach compares to firms focusing onsamedomain NPI, that is, manufacturers launching new goods and service firms introducing new services. This research investigates these innovation approaches at the firm level using a set of archival data for the period 2006–2008, which comprises 16,735 manufacturing and service firms from 11 European countries. Our results show no statistical difference in innovation revenue performance between same and different domain NPIs. Both categories of firms gained about 13–14% higher performance relative to those firms that reported ongoing innovation activities but did not introduce any innovation. Our findings also show firms that pursuedbothsame and different domain NPIs (a dual innovation approach) achieved a higher innovation revenue performance (about 4% higher relative to firms pursuing same or different domain NPI). Despite the higher performance, we find that the interaction effect of same and different domain NPIs on firm innovation revenue issubstitutive. Our results are largely consistent across multiple robustness checks: (a) a different dataset collected for the period 2008–2010 to replicate the findings, (b) alternative dependent variables, (c) multiple endogeneity checks, and (d) different estimation approaches. Finally, post-hoc analyses show the substitution effect is (i) stronger for small firms, (ii) stronger for firms with internal R&D, and (iii) not significantly different for firms with or without external R&D. Overall, these findings contribute to a nuanced understanding of the opportunity and tension firms face in introducing innovations in same and different domain activities."
"Project managers' breadth of experience, project complexity, and project performance",Fabrizio Salvador,09 June 2021,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1140,"AbstractResearch has found that a project manager's experience is a driver of project performance. However, whether specialist or generalist project managers are more effective remains an open question to date. In this paper, we examine how project managers' breadth of experience influences project completion time under different levels of project complexity. Using longitudinal data from 9,765 enterprise resource planning (ERP) system projects executed by a software services organization, we find that managers' breadth of experience has a U-shaped impact on project completion time. We also find that while we can identify an optimal level of breadth of experience that minimizes project completion time on the U-curve, this optimal level becomes lower (the U-curve shifts to the left) as project complexity increases. As project complexity decreases, the U-curve flattens and tends to become monotonically decreasing, signifying that diseconomies from project managers' breadth of experience are less apparent in simpler projects. From a practical standpoint, these findings suggest that project managers' breadth of experience is a critical driver of project performance that should be a key consideration in the selection of managers to lead knowledge work, especially for complex projects."
What warrants our claims? A methodological evaluation of argument structure,Mikko Ketokivi,24 March 2021,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1137,"AbstractThe process of justifying a generalized theoretical conclusion from a specific empirical analysis continues to elude us. In this article, we suggest that this stems from an incomplete understanding and specification of how arguments are structured. Most importantly, in addition to empirical data, a generalized conclusion hinges on the application of various rules and principles of reasoning that British philosopher Stephen Toulmin labeledwarrants. In this article, we apply Toulmin's model of argument structure to empirical management research by examining in particular the roles of four types of warrants: theoretical, inferential, procedural, and contextual. Based on our analysis, we suggest that making warrants and their backings explicit paves the way toward a more comprehensive understanding of how arguments are structured and how claims are justified. Importantly, an examination of warrants reveals that the choices researchers make are not limited to matters such as choosing the research topic or a particular research design, but they also extend to how we produce our claims. If we wish to understand argument structure, we must understand these choices."
Inventory diagnosis for flow improvement—A design science approach,Martin J. Land,06 January 2021,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1133,"AbstractImproving flow is a core Operations Management theme that is set to become even more important following contemporary developments in manufacturing, such as smart products and digital encapsulation that enable new control concepts such as multi-agent holonic control. But, companies often struggle to realize flow improvements in practice, both with and without new technologies. While the literature agrees on the importance of flow, a structured and independent process that supports managers in identifying the root causes of why flow items wait in inventories instead of being processed is missing. Managers often use a single production management concept, such as lean production or the theory of constraints, when they seek to understand the reasons for a flow problem, which may lead to misdirected and unsuccessful interventions. In response, we use design science to develop a comprehensive approach to diagnosing flow problems that is independent from any production management concept. This diagnosis process results from successive iterations with five companies and supports the selection of appropriate analytical models and flow improvement solutions. It enables an organization to widen the focus of its flow improvement actions beyond the scope of a singular production management concept and complements the application of recent advances in technology, allowing smart products to quickly interpret what is happening in a location without first simulating and analyzing the whole system. Furthermore, the study expands buffer theories by showing that buffers have an internal hierarchy and can be absorbed by other buffers, while enhancing other theories related to coordination, material flow control, and lean improvement."
The consequences of self-reporting biases: Evidence from the crash preventability program,Alex Scott,01 June 2021,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1149,"AbstractRelying on firms to self-report information is an information-gathering mechanism that often results in biased measures due to the incentives of the reporting firms. What is less commonly understood is that using self-reported information for decision-making results in endogenous selection bias, which creates spurious associations between the measure being reported and factors that influence reporting. Thus, conditioning on self-reported information can lead to inaccurate evaluations of firms and bias predictions of future performance, even when the self-reported measure is not intentionally misrepresented. We examine endogenous selection bias in self-reporting regimes using directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). We illustrate the problem using data from a policy change by the U.S. Department of Transportation that allowed firms to report not-at-fault for accidents. We find that large for-hire firms are much more likely to report not-at-fault for accidents—over 40 times more likely than independent drivers—even after controlling for time, location, and weather. When comparing independent drivers with large firms, the reporting disparities make large firms appear 25% safer when using at-fault accidents versus all accidents while providing no improvement in predicting future accidents. This study highlights the consequences of poorly designed information-gathering mechanisms and the usefulness of DAGs for understanding causality in supply chain research."
The lenses of lean: Visioning the science and practice of efficiency,Wallace J. Hopp,21 September 2020,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1115,"AbstractThere is a significant gap between the descriptions of Lean used by industry practitioners and the various bodies of academic research that have studied the theory and application of Lean. There is also a gap between applied research on Lean and basic research in the mathematical, physical and social sciences. As a result, Lean practice is based largely on trial-and-error experience while potentially valuable research results remain locked away unused in archival journals. This paper attempts to close these gaps by describing four “Lenses of Lean,” each of which aligns with a practical perspective and rests on a distinct body of conceptual research. Our hope is that this framework will provide a useful construct for Lean training and implementation and will also spur academic research that is relevant to advancing Lean practice."

Is a large award truly attractive to solvers? The impact of award size on crowd size in innovation contests,Zhongzhi Liu,28 December 2020,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1132,"AbstractFirms increasingly use human crowds to solve their innovation related needs. Innovation sourcing managers who sponsor innovation contests seek to maximize crowd size to increase the chance of creative outcomes. One strategy they use is to set an award size. Although many studies have examined the influence of award size on crowd size in innovation contests, the empirical findings are inconsistent and suggest further empirical study is needed. Drawing from expectancy-value theory, we propose that award size and crowd size are related to one another in the form of an inverted U-shape, namely that moderate awards maximize crowd size. Additional propositions cover contingencies around the number of awards and task difficulty of an innovation contest. Based on data representing 5342 programming innovation contests, our empirical analyses confirm the inverted U-shaped relationship and indicate that the number of awards and task difficulty steepen the inverted U-shaped relationship. These results add nuanced, theoretical understanding of how innovation contests work. The findings indicate that innovation sourcing managers should set award sizes at moderate levels, and that they should experiment with slightly larger or smaller awards to see if it impacts crowd size in their context."
Commitment follows beliefs: A configurational perspective on operations managers' commitment to practice adoption,Maricela C. Arellano,21 December 2020,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1130,"AbstractCompanies that seek to improve their operational performance by adopting new practices often report disappointing adoption rates. The literature concerning practice adoption has tended to focus on efficacy and legitimacy drivers at the organizational level. However, there exists convincing evidence that practice adoption largely depends on the commitment of those managers involved in the adoption of a given practice. Thus, we investigate what prompts operations managers to commit to practice adoption. We draw on the theory of planned behavior to explore the cognitive foundations of 76 operations managers' commitment to new operational practices. Using fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis, we identify three belief configurations associated with high levels of commitment—“the Follower,” “the Pragmatist,” and “the Reformer.” We contribute a behavioral operations perspective to the literature on practice adoption by providing an individual-level and configurational view of managerial commitment to change."
Untangling drivers for supplier environmental and social responsibility: An investigation in Philips Lighting's Chinese supply chain,Verónica H. Villena,16 December 2020,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1131,"AbstractThis study unpacks the environmental and social dimensions of supplier responsibility and links each dimension to distinct drivers. Using stakeholder theory and the relational view, we distinguish between two main drivers: stakeholder pressures (i.e., from regulatory agencies, buying firms, and nongovernmental organizations) and relational mechanisms offered by multinational companies (MNCs) (i.e., lean trainings and relational capital). We used a multi-method research design to study how these drivers uniquely influence supplier responsibility in an emerging-country context. An in-depth case study with Philips Lighting and 10 of its Chinese suppliers reveals causal inferences that link stakeholder and relational drivers with each responsibility dimension (environmental vs. social). Audit and survey data from Philips Lighting's 134 Chinese suppliers, complemented with four archival databases, bolster these inferences. Overall, the results show that supplier environmental responsibility can be fostered through both stakeholder pressures and relational drivers; whereas, supplier social responsibility is much harder to address. The integrated methods offer a fuller, more comprehensive understanding of the specifics of supplier responsibility in China and also provide recommendations for MNCs that seek to improve it."
The impact of free returns on online purchase behavior: Evidence from an intervention at an online retailer,Pankaj C. Patel,01 March 2021,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1135,"AbstractWhether free returns create economic value for online retailers is a question of increasing importance. Using order-level data from an online fashion retailer in Sweden, we investigate the introduction of free returns for customers in Denmark starting November 1, 2017, but not for customers in Sweden, Norway, Finland, France, Germany, and the rest of Europe (the control group). Using difference-in-differences, with and without sample matching, the introduction of free returns increased the order bill by 54.95 Swedish Krona (SEK) (9.15%), product variety per order by 0.057 (8.74%), gross margin per order by 29.90 SEK (9.71%), and returns by 0.195 items per order (7.86%). This likelihood of increased returns was generally similar across different product categories. The findings are robust to parallel trends, event studies, placebo effects, alternative control groups (with Scandinavian countries, Sweden and Norway), country-time trends, and correlations between outcome variables. Based on back-of-the-envelope calculations, the cost of offering free returns is greater than the increase in gross profit driven by free returns. Though our results show that free returns may not be of short-term benefit, retailers must also consider the long-term strategic implications of free returns."
Spillover effects of information leakages in buyer–supplier–supplier triads,Leopold Ried,29 September 2020,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1116,"AbstractInformation leakages—the unauthorized sharing of an organization's information with another organization—are a growing concern in today's supply chains, but remain relatively underexplored. Drawing on attribution theory and observational learning, our research investigates inter-organizational information leakages from a network perspective. We assess the spillover effects of opportunistic and inadvertent information leakages between anOFFENDERorganization and aVICTIMorganization on the relationship between theOFFENDERand a nonpartisanOBSERVER. We consider the roles of integrity- and ability-based trust, as well as operational similarity between the organizations. We conducted scenario-based experiments with 181 sales practitioners recruited via MTurk and supplemented those results with post hoc interviews. Our results show clear spillover effects: TheOBSERVER's willingness to share information with theOFFENDERdecreases significantly after any type of information leakage between theOFFENDERand theVICTIM,but more so for opportunistic leakages. Integrity-based trust mediates the relationship between intentionality and information sharing willingness. We also find indications of an unexpected collateral damage effect in that to some extent, both trust dimensions decrease in both forms of information leakage. Further, for opportunistic information leakages, theOBSERVER's willingness to share information with theOFFENDERdecreases more whenOBSERVERandVICTIMare operationally similar."
Exploratory data science for discovery and ex-ante assessment of operational policies: Insights from vehicle sharing,Tobias Brandt,12 October 2020,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1125,"AbstractThe proliferation of mobile devices and the emergence of the Internet of Things are leading to an unprecedented availability of operational data. In this article, we study how leveraging this data in conjunction with data science methods can help researchers and practitioners in the development and evaluation of new operational policies. Specifically, we introduce a two-stage framework for exploratory data science consisting of a policy identification stage and an ex-ante policy assessment stage. We apply the framework to the context of free-floating carsharing—a novel mobility service that is an example of data-rich smart city services. Through data exploration, we identify a novel preventive user-based relocation policy and provide an ex-ante assessment regarding the feasibility of its implementation. We discuss practical implications of our approach and results for shared-mobility providers as well as the relationship between data science and operations management research."
The influence of perceived host country political risk on foreign subunits' supplier development strategies,Remi Charpin,19 October 2020,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1127,"AbstractRecent protectionist trends (e.g., trade wars, Brexit) have challenged the stability of the global supply chains (SCs) of multinational corporations. While the SC and operations management (SC/OM) literature has examined how such sources of political risk influence strategic SC/OM decisions at the global level, we know little about how host country political risk influences the SC/OM practices of foreign subunits at the local level. We conducted an exploratory, multiple-case study of western subunits operating in China to investigate whether managers of foreign subunits in a host country perceive political risk; and if so, how they adapt their SC/OM strategic choices to reduce its impact on their subunits. Our empirical findings suggest that variations in political risk perceptions create different political legitimacy goals that subunits attempt to meet by adapting their supplier development strategies. We induct a process model and identify three archetypes of supplier development strategy—self-centered, collaborative, and voluntary—adopted by subunits to shape their legitimacy and mitigate political risk. We contribute to the SC/OM literature by theorizing SC/OM managers' perceived political risk, showing how foreign subunits may use supplier development to influence how the host government views them, and by complementing traditional “corporate” legitimacy-seeking strategies with new “SC/OM” legitimacy-seeking strategies."
Consumers care and firms should too: On the benefits of disclosing supplier monitoring activities,Yanji Duan,15 December 2020,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1129,"AbstractStakeholders increasingly put pressure on firms to ensure their suppliers' adherence to corporate social responsibility principles and standards. A firm's supplier monitoring activities (SMA) are, thus, central to achieving supply chain transparency. In an effort to help build a business case for SMA, this research explores the effect of SMA disclosures on consumers' attitude toward the firm and purchase intention. In so doing, we also examine how consumer attitude and purchase intention vary as a function of SMA disclosure characteristics. The results of three behavioral studies reveal more positive consumer attitude and higher purchase intention when a firm discloses that its supplier monitoring extends to lower-tier suppliers (SMA depth) and the firm monitors its lower-tier suppliers directly rather than relying on its first-tier suppliers or third parties to do so (lower-tier supplier monitoring mechanism). Greater SMA breadth—monitoring both suppliers' social and environmental activities—in turn, is not associated with more positive consumer attitude and higher purchase intention. Further, attitude toward the firm mediates the relationship between SMA disclosure characteristics and purchase intention. Collectively, these findings underline that consumers value firms' SMA and point toward an economic rationale for a firm's transparency regarding its supplier monitoring efforts."
Leaving it on the table? An examination of unrealized bargaining power in multimarket buyer–supplier exchanges,Li Cheng,29 September 2020,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1121,"AbstractThe study of bargaining power and its role in negotiations has a long history in operations management research. Much of this research has involved buyer–supplier exchanges and has often hinged on the assumption that powerful firms negotiate to wield (fully) their power for favorable outcomes. Yet, it is unclear to what extent firms transform their potential power into realized power. Building on insights grounded in resource dependence theory and literature on competitive dynamics and organization design, we theorize that structural factors (i.e., decentralization, spheres of influence, and mutual dependence) constrain firms from fully realizing their potential power. In doing so, we center on a more nuanced context—multimarket buyer–supplier exchanges, wherein buyers and suppliers handle multiple exchanges across different product markets. We use two controlled negotiation experiments to test our hypotheses. Our results show that in multimarket exchanges, three key factors (and how they sometimes interact) constrain power use. These results offer boundary conditions to extant theory. Most profoundly, our results reveal that centralization (traditionally viewed as a structural lever toenhancepower use) alone does not affect power use but has distinct effects conditional on other factors—countering theory and challenging best practices in industry."
Microdosing flexibility in an efficient supply chain,Lance W. Saunders,05 October 2020,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1117,"AbstractThe designation of a supply chain as efficient or responsive has often been considered to be a dichotomy in theory and practice. This technical note explores this issue by describing an engagement by the research team with a large consumer packaged-goods company within their cosmetics supply chain during the launch of a new product family. The company was experiencing high supply–demand mismatch costs that they attributed to their supply chain that was designed to emphasize efficiency over responsiveness. We analyzed the appropriateness of the supply-chain design through the lens of theory and concluded that the efficient design was in fact a good match for the product. A simulation model allowed us to organize available data and identify the root cause of the mismatch costs. Results from the simulation showed that the mismatch costs stemmed primarily from a failure to deploy small but important responsiveness opportunities: Because the supply chain was designated as efficient, responsiveness was ignored, and this substantially increased mismatches. Mismatches also occurred because decision makers failed to distinguish between delivery and decision lead time."
Frontlog scheduling in aircraft line maintenance: From explorative solution design to theoretical insight into buffer management,Mikael Öhman,10 July 2020,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1108,"AbstractBased on a multi-year research engagement with practice, we present a novel solution design forfrontlogscheduling in aircraft line maintenance and offer theoretical insights into buffer management in operations. The field problem of the case airline was to improve departure reliability for long-haul aircraft without increasing maintenance resources, and without using backup aircraft. Frontlog scheduling is the purposeful introduction of over-maintenance as a buffer of maintenance tasks that can be opportunistically postponed. A detailed simulation of the solution introduced in the airline's operations indicates a performance frontier shift, concurrently improving departure reliability, and reducing maintenance cost. We position the novel practice in operations and maintenance management literature, arguing that the frontlog creates a new type of time buffer, available in contexts where capacity serves predictable as well as unpredictable demand. Further theoretical elaboration leads us to reconceptualize buffer management along time and capacity dimensions, reducing inventory to a special case of time buffering."
Unintended responses to IT-enabled monitoring: The case of the electronic logging device mandate,Alex Scott,28 July 2020,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1110,"AbstractResearch shows that electronic monitoring technologies can reduce illicit agent (e.g., frontline worker) behavior along monitored dimensions such that principals (e.g., firms) benefit. Drawing on theory from criminology regarding the concept of offense displacement, we explain why the benefits from increased monitoring may be mitigated if agents subsequently increase other types of illicit acts not subject to greater monitoring. We investigate this possibility by examining how a mandate requiring millions of truck drivers to adopt electronic logging devices to record their working hours affected different safety behaviors and outcomes. Using data from millions of driver inspections and crash counts before and after the mandate and a differences-in-differences identification strategy, we find greater monitoring due to the mandate achieved its first-order effect of reducing the frequency that drivers were in non-compliance with work hour rules (the monitored dimension). However, drivers for small firms that were most affected by the mandate also appear to have increased their frequency of unsafe driving (e.g., speeding). We also find that crash counts for small firms did not fall relative to large firms, and may have increased. These results call into question whether increased electronic monitoring has improved safety in this industry."
The retrospective determination of process improvement's economic value at the individual manufacturing firm level: Literature review and proposed measurement framework,Urban Wemmerlöv,05 October 2020,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1112,"AbstractEven a cursory reading of the literature on process improvement shows that there are many accounts proposing that operational as well as financial gains can be made using methodologies like JIT, TQM, Six Sigma, and Lean. While some studies have investigated the statistical links between process improvement practices and corporate financial outcomes in large populations of firms, documentations of how individual firms can determine economic value derived from their own process improvement projects are scarce. We reviewed the literature, first ad hoc then systematically, to investigate the extent to which studies have covered the determination of process improvements' economic value in manufacturing companies postimplementation, and how such assessments are conducted. The results suggest that retrospective value determinations at the plant level are exceedingly rare. In fact, only 0.09% of 35,968 scholarly articles produced on process improvement in the period 1980–2020 have that focus. Since expenditures on process improvement have alternative uses, organizations should have at their disposal benefit determination frameworks so that financially efficient decisions can be made. Building on literature reviews and additional sources, this study proposes a set of principles and a model for cost–benefit determination that make up such a framework in the context of process improvement."
Sustainable process improvements: Evidence from intervention-based research,Gopesh Anand,07 October 2020,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1119,"AbstractThis research develops a methodology for making process improvements that can sustain over time. Working with caregivers at a large U.S. hospital over 3 years, we redesign a process for educating kidney transplant patients with instructions for post-surgical care. Adopting an intervention-based research (IBR) framework and based on our actions to overcome challenges in implementation and sustainment of the redesign, we revise the current understanding of organizational learning theory. Follow-up observations after our intervention show that the process improvements at the hospital are sustained. We supplement the IBR with quantitative analyses and provide evidence of improvements in health outcomes and satisfaction levels of patients associated with the redesign. These analyses are based on difference-in-difference estimations using data from transplant patients, including a control group from other transplant units. Overall, our research specifies a methodology for implementing sustainable process improvements, particularly in high interaction service environments such as healthcare delivery, and identifies refinements to organizational learning theory, especially for such environments."
CSR orientation incongruence and supply chain relationship performance—A network perspective,Yi Liu,29 September 2020,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1118,"AbstractFirms’ commitment to corporate social responsibility (CSR) can be a crucial factor in supply chain partnerships. This study examines the effect of CSR orientation incongruence on relationship performance. Drawing on the congruence theory literature, we posit that a firm's relationship performance may suffer when there is incongruence between the levels of CSR orientations of supply chain partners. Furthermore, we adopt a network perspective and argue that certain characteristics of a firm's egocentric social network (i.e., network centrality and network diversity) may moderate the linkage between CSR orientation incongruence and relationship performance. Our empirical study, which is based on dyadic data, indeed reveals that a firm's relationship performance is adversely affected when the firm and its major supply partner have incongruent levels of CSR orientations. Such a negative effect is moderated by the firm's egocentric social network. Specifically, the negative impact of incongruent CSR orientation is heightened if the firm occupies a central position in the egocentric network. Network diversity, however, plays a contrasting role as a firm's relationship performance may be less susceptible to incongruent CSR orientations when there is access to a diverse social network."
"On making experimental design choices: Discussions on the use and challenges of demand effects, incentives, deception, samples, and vignettes",Stephanie Eckerd,12 November 2020,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1128,"AbstractIn late 2018, theJournal of Operations Managementpublished an invited methods article by Lonati et al. (2018) to provide guidance to authors on how to design behavioral experiments to achieve the rigor required for consideration in the journal. That article was written as a response to a number of behavioral research submissions toJOM, each dealing with interesting topics but viewed by the editors to possess poor design choices at inception. While the Lonati et al. (2018) piece provides experimental guidance fitting to certain research agendas, questions have arisen concerning whether and how exactly to implement some of the points that it makes, and how to best address trade-offs in the design of behavioral experiments. Questions have also arisen concerning how to apply these concepts in operations management research. This technical note seeks to address these questions, by diving into the details of research risks and trade-offs regarding demand effects, incentives, deception, sample selection, and context-rich vignettes. The authors would like to recognize the input of a large number of senior scholars in theJOMcommunity who have provided support and feedback as we have sought to help authors tease out what can reasonably be done in designing strong behavioral experiments that fit various research agendas."
"On empirically estimating bullwhip effects: Measurement, aggregation, and impact",Yuliang Yao,09 April 2020,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1090,"AbstractEmpirical estimation of the bullwhip effect poses several challenges, although the bullwhip effect has been well studied in modeling papers. Using a dataset from a large supermarket chain, we estimate the product level bullwhip effect using various methods, analyze consequences of its different measurements and aggregations, and examine its impact on supply chain performance in terms of inventory ratio and stockouts. We have three major findings. (a) Bullwhip effect estimates exhibit different magnitudes dependent on how they are measured. The material bullwhip effect is greater in magnitude than the information bullwhip effect in our data, where demand correlations are sufficiently low. (b) The aggregated bullwhip effect ratios by store and by time are lower than the disaggregated bullwhip effect ratios, indicating that the aggregated bullwhip effect ratios underestimate the bullwhip effect. The aggregated bullwhip effect ratios by product are lower than the disaggregated bullwhip effect ratios, indicating the bullwhip effect is not as strong as theory predicts due to order pooling. (c) The bullwhip effect is associated with poor supply chain performance, as measured by elevated inventory ratio and stockouts. However, if the bullwhip effect is measured inaccurately, these benefits can be underestimated as much as 75% for inventory and 25% for stockouts."
Execution quality and chargeback penalties in retail supply chains,Nathan Craig,04 May 2020,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1092,"AbstractRetailers procure inventory by placing purchase orders (POs) with suppliers. POs specify product price, quantity, quality, delivery times, and other aspects of the fulfillment process, such as carton labeling requirements and packaging formats. When servicing an order, a supplier may fail to meet the fulfillment terms, thus committing a fulfillment error and triggering a chargeback penalty. We collect supplier compliance manuals from 111 retailers to characterize fulfillment errors and chargebacks in practice. The majority of chargeback penalties listed by retailers pertain toexecution quality: aspects of the fulfillment process beyond product price, quantity, quality, and delivery time. We use an empirically grounded analytical model in combination with game-theoretic analysis to demonstrate that the chargebacks most commonly used in practice do a poor job coordinating supply chains around execution quality."
Bilateral dependency and supplier performance ambiguity in supply chain contracting: Evidence from the railroad industry,Akhil Bhardwaj,22 June 2020,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1103,"AbstractResearch on supply chain relationships tends to focus on power and asymmetric dependency. Our objective is to complement this by examining contractual challenges in the context of bilateral dependency. Our specific empirical focus is on how Indian Railways, one of the largest railroads in the world, manages warranty claims related to engine failures. Warranty resolution is complex, because failures typically involve the simultaneous failure of several engine subsystems provided by different suppliers, giving rise to supplier performance ambiguity. Through a combination of theoretical reflection rooted in transaction cost economics and an empirical analysis of Indian Railways' supply chain, we argue that in the case of bilateral dependency, “the benign approach” is more efficient than “the muscular approach,” to use Oliver Williamson's terminology. Specifically, while the latter is founded on unilateral decisions by the comparatively more powerful party, the former is based on voluntary long-term cooperation, and calls for mutual credible commitments and joint problem-solving. Additionally, we highlight that even if dependency is asymmetric at the outset, it can develop bilateral features over time. Theoretically, our research offers an enhanced understanding of trust in buyer–supplier relationships, emphasizing its organizational as opposed to personal basis."
The role of transparency in procurement: Revealed versus concealed scoring rules in sealed bid A + B auctions,Bernardo F. Quiroga,23 June 2020,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1104,"AbstractWe investigate the impact of using a clear scoring rule in a sealed bid multi-dimensional (A+B) procurement auction, as frequently used in government procurement. The central procurement agency in Chile (ChileCompra) asked for help to understand how concealing the scoring rule affected buyers. Using an experiment, we analyze the effect of transparently communicating the scoring rule on bidding outcomes by comparing the buyer's surplus and supplier profits when buyers expressly communicate the weight they place on a nonmonetary (B) attribute, versus when this information is concealed from bidders. In addition, we compare outcomes where the scoring rule is made visible only after the offers are submitted. If the scoring rule is not disclosed, outcomes are poorer for buyers, and sellers see their profits increase."
Product personalization and firm performance: An empirical analysis of the pharmaceutical industry,Marouen Ben-Jebara,29 July 2020,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1109,"AbstractRecent advances in manufacturing and communication technology have made it possible for firms to offer products that are personalized to individual customers’ specifications. While personalizing products leads to benefits for firms, it also requires significant resources, calling into question the financial efficacy of this practice. This situation is especially salient in the pharmaceutical industry, where drugs are personalized to individuals. This type of medicine is expected to account for approximately 50% of drug spending in the U.S. market by 2022; however, the rising costs of producing and delivering such medications make their viability uncertain. In this study, we present a framework that conceptualizes a nonlinear inverted U-shaped relationship between product personalization and financial performance. We further investigate the role of supply-chain disintermediation in enhancing the benefits of personalization. Analysis of data from the pharmaceutical industry confirms that product personalization improves financial performance only up to a point, beyond which firms experience negative performance effects. Furthermore, supply-chain disintermediation moderates this relationship such that the inverted U-shape is steeper with increasing disintermediation levels. Together, these findings provide important guidelines for managers formulating their firms’ product personalization strategies."
Replication without repeating ourselves: Addressing the replication crisis in operations and supply chain management research,Mark Pagell,16 September 2020,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1120,"AbstractOperations and supply chain management (OSCM) scholars have generally not engaged in the robust discourse over the extent and implications of science's replication crisis, perhaps because replication studies remain exceedingly rare in the discipline. In this manuscript, I encourage more replications. However, I also assume that such studies will remain rare. Therefore, it is argued that the replication crisis in OSCM can be partially addressed by conducting theory testing and refining research in a more systematic fashion that acknowledges researchers' and journals' incentives to publish new knowledge, while also efficiently helping to ensure that the foundations of that new knowledge are generalizable and not based on idiosyncratic, spurious, or questionable findings. Hence, I focus on ways to conduct a replication within a larger theory testing or refining study in a manner that makes it possible to explain the results, even if they differ from past research. This is achieved via enhanced transparency, designing research to include tests of nomological validity and account for the possibility that the results will not replicate, and more careful consideration of controls. The payoff from this investment in designing replication logic into theory testing and refining research would be that in the course of conducting normal science, we would be able to make much stronger claims about the veracity of our theories, facts, and predictions."
Global operations and supply-chain management under the political economy,Di Fan,28 December 2022,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1232,
Adjusting supply chain involvement in countries with politician turnover: A contingency framework,Maggie Chuoyan Dong,07 September 2022,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1213,"AbstractAlthough the supply chain (SC) literature has discussed the influence of the political environment on global SC decisions, the role of political leaders has been overlooked. To fill this research void, we predict and show that the turnover of a country's top political leader (hereafter, “politician turnover”) increases policy uncertainty in the country, which drives multinational corporations (MNCs) to adjust their SC involvement there. We also identify three politician-related contingency factors: the market-friendliness of the successor relative to the incumbent, the length of the successor's political career, and corruption in the turnover country. In an analysis of politician turnover events from 2003 to 2018 and the global supplier-customer relationships of US-incorporated MNCs, we find that politician turnover causes MNCs to reduce SC involvement (measured as the proportions of an MNC's customers, suppliers, and the transaction volume that are located in the turnover country). The negative effect of politician turnover on SC involvement is exacerbated by corruption in the turnover country, mitigated when the successor has a long political career, and exacerbated when the successor is less market-friendly than the incumbent; the effect becomes positive when the successor is more market-friendly than the incumbent."
Competition and slack: The role of tariffs on cost stickiness,Rengong (Alex) Zhang,26 October 2021,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1162,"AbstractSlack exists when entities hold resources in excess of those required to support current operations. “Sticky” spending is a specific type of slack spending that occurs when a firm reduces spending by less when sales fall than it increases spending when sales rise by an equivalent amount. Changes in a firm's environment affect its propensity to engage in sticky spending. We examine how competition influences sticky spending, positing two hypotheses. First, we hypothesize that competition will be positively associated with firms' investment in sticky spending both for cost of goods manufactured (COGM) and selling, general, and administrative (SG&A). Second, we hypothesize that competition moderates the relation between sticky spending and firm performance. Utilizing variations of tariff rates as exogenous shocks to reflect competition, we measure sticky spending in the firm's COGM and SG&A spending. To empirically verify our hypotheses, we draw data from three different sources, industry-level tariff data, Compustat, and the Hoberg–Phillips data library, for firms in the manufacturing sector from 1974 through 2017. Our regression analyses confirm that managers maintain more stickiness in spending as competition increases. The market's assessment of firm performance (as measured by Tobin's Q) is largely positively associated with sticky spending as competition increases. This expectation of higher performance is evidenced by immediate improvements in the firm's return on assets (ROA) when we consider COGM spending, but not when we consider SG&A spending."
The impact of foreign competition on domestic firms' product quality: Evidence from a quasi-natural experiment in the United States,Hugo K. S. Lam,20 January 2022,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1169,"AbstractResearchers have investigated various factors that explain the variation in product quality across firms, but little is known about how competition from companies located in other countries may affect domestic firms' product quality. Although such foreign competition has received much attention from news media and the public, especially during the recent United States (US)–China trade war, its impact on product quality is still unclear. Our research answers this important question by conducting a quasi-natural experiment in the US, in which significant reductions in import tariff rates represent an exogenous increase in foreign competition for US firms. Performing a difference-in-differences estimation of the difference in product quality changes between treatment and control firms, our research shows that increased foreign competition has a negative impact on the product quality of the US firms concerned. However, such a negative impact is less significant for firms with high levels of operational slack and R&D intensity. Firms pursuing product differentiation rather than cost leadership strategies are also less affected by foreign competition. Overall, our research demonstrates foreign competition's negative impact on product quality and highlights the crucial role that firms' operational resources and strategies play in mitigating the negative impact."
Stock market reaction to global supply chain disruptions from the 2018 US government ban on ZTE,Brian W. Jacobs,19 June 2022,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1197,"AbstractGovernment trade actions are an increasing source of supply chain risk. This research provides empirical evidence of the stock market reaction to trade actions against a targeted firm on other firms in the targeted firm's supply chain eco-system. We test our hypothesized stock price effects using the case of the 2018 US government ban on US firms from supplying to ZTE, a Chinese telecommunications manufacturer. We estimate the ban's effects on ZTE's tier-one US and non-US suppliers, as well as the upstream and downstream supply chain propagation effects by considering ZTE's tier-two suppliers and business customers. We also estimate impacts to ZTE's competitors. We find that tier-one US suppliers experienced a stock price effect of −3.33% following the ban, and the reaction was more negative for those suppliers more dependent on ZTE for revenues. We find a stock price effect on tier-two suppliers of −0.40%, but an insignificant effect on non-US tier-one suppliers. Business customers experienced a stock price effect of 0.66%, and the competitors' stock price effect was 1.34%. The reversal of the ban 4 weeks later resulted in a stock price effect of 1.56% for tier-one US suppliers, 1.72% for tier-one non-US suppliers, and 1.35% for competitors."
Impact of the U.S.–China trade war on the operating performance of U.S. firms: The role of outsourcing and supply base complexity,Di Fan,03 October 2022,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1225,"AbstractMultinational corporations have benefited tremendously from free trade in the past few decades. However, the dynamism of international relations, paired with the global recession, has rekindled the debate over frictionless trade. In this study, we examine how trade friction, created by tariff trade barriers, affects the operational performance of domestic firms which source from the affected countries. We also investigate how various supply chain characteristics and strategies can moderate the impact of such trade friction. Motivated by the 2018 U.S.–China trade war, we conducted a difference-in-difference analysis to examine the impact of trade tariffs on performance indicators of U.S. firms with direct supplier connections in China. Specifically, we found that U.S. firms with direct supply partners (i.e., first-tier suppliers) in China had a worse performance than the U.S. firms without direct supply partners in China in terms of inventory (i.e., days of supply) and profitability (return-on-assets). We further found that the negative impacts were more severe for firms with a higher degree of outsourcing, and horizontal and spatial supply base complexity. We discuss the implications for international operations management, supply chain networks, supply risk management, and provide suggestions to supply chain practitioners and trade policymakers."

Emerging technologies and the use case: A multi-year study of drone adoption,Omid Maghazei,20 June 2022,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1196,"AbstractAlthough disruptive “Industry 4.0” technologies often lack a clear business case, vendors are advocating and companies are actively exploring their use in operations settings. The technology management literature suggests that successful adoption derives from an appropriate fit between the specific technology and (1) economic and strategic factors, (2) operational and supply chain factors, and (3) organizational and behavioral factors. Through a five-year research project, we explore how drones—an archetypal emerging technology supported by a thriving vendor ecosystem—transitioned from early ideas to experimental applications to full adoption in daily operations. We analyze a range of data, including exploratory interviews with drone ecosystem actors, a secondary dataset, and case studies of drone applications in Geberit and IKEA. Key findings relate to our observation that technology adoption patterns for emerging technologies do not always follow the traditional linear logic of technology fit. We find that emerging technologies are characterized by a dynamic interaction between technology push from a thriving ecosystem and market pull from companies exploring meaningful operational and business value using the concept of “use case.” Based on these findings, we contribute to the technology management literature with an alternative technology adoption framework for emerging “Industry 4.0” technologies."
How information technology automates and augments processes: Insights from Artificial-Intelligence-based systems in professional service operations,Martin Spring,21 September 2022,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1215,"AbstractThis study contributes to the technology management literature on the effects of IT on operations processes by examining the use of systems based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) in professional services. The paper builds on key concepts on AI, information systems, professional work, and professional services operations management. A model is developed to explain how AI-based systems combine with humans to do work, both automating and augmenting the work of the professional, leading to process improvement and extension of the service offering. The study uses case-based research in two law firms and two accountancy firms using AI-based systems. It shows that AI-based systems are used selectively, mainly on high-volume, back-office tasks, across the sequence of stages in the professional service process—diagnosis, inference, and treatment. Automation using AI relieves professionals from repetitive tasks, while AI achieves augmentation by buffering professionals from low-value activity, making their expertise scalable and providing new analytical insights. System use can improve performance in delivering core professional services and enable service extension into additional, high-value advisory work. The model and research approach have potential implications for other emerging areas of technology management in OM."
Emancipatory technology and developing-world supply chains: A case study of African women gemstone miners,Jordana George,29 August 2022,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1217,"AbstractArtisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) make up roughly 90% of the colored gemstone trade, a still untamed industry where money laundering, cartels, arms purchases, and crime run rampant while many miners prospect and dream of finding “the big one.” Women make up to 30% to 50% of ASM, often in developing regions. Struggling to make a living and support their families, women miners are subject to discrimination, unfair labor practices, and poor access to rich foreign markets. Grounded in a longitudinal case study in Africa, this qualitative research examines the journey of an organization seeking to emancipate women miners through supply chains that embrace technology, provenance, and disintermediation. This research demonstrates the strategic value of emancipatory technologies for firms. Secondly, we find evidence that combinations of storytelling and digital records create multidimensional provenance that mitigates a number of supply chain risks, particularly in tainted chains. Lastly, this research extends Tang's framework for engaging marginalized populations as suppliers and producers."
Task management in decentralized autonomous organization,Xi Zhao,19 April 2022,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1179,"AbstractIn the emerging platform economy, blockchain technologies are reshaping the digital economy. Moreover, disintermediation and decentralization have broken new ground for platform organizations and management mechanisms and instigated the concept of a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization). Recent literature on operations management has called for further research on governance issues related to DAOs. In response to this call, we explore the relationship between DAO management efforts and platform performance in this study. Specifically, we propose and theoretically articulate decentralized voting tasks in DAOs as a new form of organizing. Harnessing both online and on-chain data from seven sources, we empirically examine how voting task division, task allocation, reward distribution, and information provision affect platform performance in the context of MakerDAO (an Ethereum-based stablecoin issuance platform). Our findings reveal that strategic decisions arrived at through voting have a positive impact on platform operational performance under certain conditions, whereas operational decisions resulting from voting have a negative impact. Moreover, we elucidate the moderating effects of voting task execution characteristics on the relationship between completed decision tasks and operational performance. These findings have important implications from both theoretical and practical perspectives. We also share all the raw data we use to promote the development of blockchain-related empirical research."
Strategic behavior for hotel standby upgrade programs: Empirical evidence and pricing implications,Övünç Yılmaz,24 March 2022,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1177,"AbstractMany hotels have recently started to offer room upgrades digitally after the completion of booking to replace traditional front-desk upselling during check-in. Quickly becoming popular for upselling the premium rooms that may otherwise go unsold, standby upgrade—an availability-based, discounted premium room upgrade—is a prominent example. However, customers, in particular loyalty members, may become knowledgeable about standby upgrades through repeated interactions with this technology, and act strategically, that is, initially choose a standard room with the expectation of being offered a premium room discount through standby upgrades. Consequently, while enjoying the benefits of this program, hotels may face the potential cannibalization of premium sales due to such strategic behavior and need to adjust their pricing accordingly. Using a major hotel chain's 16-month booking and standby upgrades data, we empirically investigate the existence and extent of strategic customers in the context of standby upgrades. After showing preliminary evidence of potential strategic behavior, we develop a maximum likelihood estimator to estimate the percentage of customers who are strategic. This estimator captures the sequential nature of customer decision-making for standby upgrades (booking decision, clicking the standby upgrades offer, and requesting an upgrade) through a Sequential Logit Model. We find evidence of strategic behavior in three (out of eight) hotels examined. Considering both a weak-form and a strong-form strategic behavior, our estimates suggest that 12%–42% of the loyalty customers act strategically in these three properties. We then propose a new pricing policy to help hoteliers maximize their premium room revenues from direct bookings and standby upgrade requests. This policy recommends a discounted full price, but also a higher standby upgrade price for loyalty customers, which can bring a revenue improvement of up to 19% over a policy ignoring the strategic behavior and 34% over a policy assuming that all customers are strategic—two reasonable benchmarks without an estimate of the fraction of strategic customers. Our research, thus, provides insights for technology managers on the potential customer behavioral challenges that a hotel may face with the adoption of a disruptive digital technology, and how existing policies may need to be adjusted for the technology to be successful."
The single-sourcing versus multisourcing decision in information technology outsourcing,Sean Handley,09 March 2022,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1174,"AbstractAlthough using a single vendor when outsourcing information technology (IT) services (i.e., single-sourcing) is commonplace, splitting the IT service package among multiple vendors (i.e., multisourcing) is an increasingly popular strategy. However, our understanding of the factors that contribute to this trend is limited. Guided by a thorough review of the extant literature and interviews with industry experts, we focus on the influence of emerging technologies (i.e., cloud-based services and automation services), vendor location (i.e., offshore or domestic), and experiential learning (i.e., client and vendor experience) on the choice between single-sourcing and multisourcing for IT services. The trend towards more multisourcing exemplifies a broader movement towards greater disaggregation and distribution of knowledge work. Thus, we utilize a knowledge-based perspective to develop our hypotheses for how the aforementioned factors relate to the likelihood of multisourcing. Analyzing a large database of IT service contracts, we find that cloud-based services are less likely to be multisourced, but automation services are not significantly associated with the likelihood of multisourcing. We also find that more experienced client firms are more likely to adopt multisourcing. Conversely, our results indicate that more experienced vendors and vendors located offshore are less likely to be part of multisourcing arrangements. Exploratory post hoc analyses yield additional interesting insights related to client and vendor location. These findings advance our understanding of the drivers of the single-sourcing versus multisourcing decision in IT and more broadly contribute to the literature on technology sourcing. Our study has normative implications for both client and vendor management teams."
"Globally distributed technology projects thrive on experience working together apart: Impacts of team balance, task balance, and task heterogeneity",Alex Alblas,21 September 2022,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1206,"AbstractEnabling shared experiences could be key to managing technology projects successfully. The advantages gained from the experience of working together can be complemented, but also offset, by common aspects of technology projects—like the dispersion of team members and the integration of heterogeneous tasks across global sites. This study develops and tests a conceptual framework that scrutinizes the impact of team familiarity and task allocation challenges. It identifies three elements of task allocation in technology projects that affect the familiarization process: (i)team (im)balance, (ii)task (im)balance, and (iii)task heterogeneity. An examination of 27,948 software tasks in six projects involving teams working apart on heterogeneous and dispersed tasks in the Netherlands and India shows that the experience of working together apart reduces the average cost of software tasks. This positive effect is enhanced by task heterogeneity and team balance, despite being hampered by task balance. These findings shed new light on task allocation challenges in cross-organizational technology projects distributed over the world."
Global buyer–supplier networks and innovation: The role of technological distance and technological breadth,Shubhobrata Palit,21 September 2022,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1205,"AbstractOne of the critical challenges of technology management for a firm is managing technological knowledge. This study focuses on available technological knowledge in a firm's global supplier network and examines factors that accrue innovation benefits from such knowledge for a buyer firm. Using absorptive capacity as a theoretical lens, we specifically examine technological distance, technological breadth, and extent of global sourcing, and how these factors interrelate in influencing a firm's innovation performance. The panel data is drawn from various sources (Bloomberg SPLC, PATSTAT Global, and Compustat). Our sample spans four years from 2011 through 2014 and comprises an unbalanced panel of 878 firm-year observations derived from buyer–supplier relationship data of 246 unique buyer firms. Embedded in this data are 846 unique supplier firms and 9291 dyads (buyer–supplier pairs). The findings confirm the negative association between technological distance and innovation performance, and the positive association between technological breadth and innovation performance. Contrary to expectations, technological distance plays a negative moderating role in the relationship between technological breadth and innovation performance. The results also show that while the extent of a firm's global sourcing has a positive relationship with its innovation performance, the relationship changes with technological distance."
Estimating impacts of logistics processes on online customer ratings: Consequences of providing technology-enabled order tracking data to customers,M. Serkan Akturk,27 July 2022,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1204,"AbstractRecent advances in logistics tracking technologies have enabled e-commerce firms to both accurately track the shipments and obtain accurate estimates of delivery times. With customers constantly tracking the status of their orders, the effects of logistics processes on customers' evaluation of their online shopping experience are relatively unknown as academic literature provides little guidance. Drawing upon the expectation-disconfirmation theory and attribution theory, and using a unique dataset assembled in collaboration with an e-commerce firm, we empirically investigate the effects of order processing and delivery times on online customer ratings. We also estimate the impact of positive deviation (i.e., early delivery) and negative deviation (i.e., late delivery) from the promised delivery date on online customer ratings and whether the impact of delivery status (early or late) depends on order cost and freight cost. Our empirical findings demonstrate that longer order processing and delivery times are associated with lower ratings. Our results also highlight that the late delivery of an order is negatively associated with ratings and that the order cost amplifies this effect. Furthermore, freight cost reduces both the negative effect of late delivery and the positive effect of early delivery on online ratings. Our results also indicate that there exist curvilinear relationships between online ratings and the number of days an online order is late or early. Specifically, the negative effect of a late delivery follows a convex-shape curve such that its impact decreases as the number of days an online order is late increases. Likewise, the positive effect of an early delivery increases at a decreasing rate as the number of days an online order is early increases. Our supplementary analyses further account for potential endogeneity issues and corroborate our main results with additional empirical evidence obtained through alternative model specifications and estimation strategies. We present important theoretical implications and managerial takeaways from our findings."
Designing technology for on-demand delivery: The effect of customer tipping on crowdsourced driver behavior and last mile performance,Vincent E. Castillo,23 May 2022,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1187,"AbstractCrowdsourcing technology platforms specializing in on-demand last mile delivery face a novel problem—heightened agent independence increases uncertainty in last mile delivery and has the potential to undermine operational performance. Uncertainty emanates from drivers' competing interests, or opportunity costs. Rather than increase remuneration, some platforms have designed the technology to allow customers to tip, but the subsequent effects on driver behavior and last mile performance have not yet been studied. We explore this feature of on-demand delivery technology design—customer tipping—and its implications for crowdsourced delivery performance. Using netnography and secondary data sources, we empirically ground an adaptive, multi-agent hybrid simulation to propose how customer tipping impacts service performance through context-contingent driver behavior. Our results generally indicate that tipping as a technology design feature mitigates uncertainty in the crowdsourced delivery fleet and reduces fulfillment times and unit delivery costs. We also find evidence suggesting that the impact of tipping on driver behavior is geography-contingent, with tipping having unexpectedly detrimental effects in high population density areas relative to low-density areas. We conclude by making a series of theoretical propositions and managerial implications about designing technology to facilitate crowdsourced delivery."
Supply chain transformation and technology management challenges in developing regions: Inductive theory building from rural Chinese nanostores,Xitong Guo,15 July 2022,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1198,"AbstractRural nanostores are the dominant source of packaged products for consumers in rural China, thus the more these stores order from reliable suppliers, the better the product quality available to rural areas. To improve merchandise circulation in rural areas, the Chinese government embarked on the large-scale “Thousands of Villages” (ToV) program in 2005. One of its key components was the implementation of an information technology (IT) procurement system to facilitate transactions between rural nanostores and the ToV program's certified consumer packaged goods (CPG) suppliers. The nanostores' adoption of the ToV procurement system was encouraged yet voluntary. We study how this system was used initially and how it evolved over time. If effective, this program has the potential to address the growing social disparity between rural and developed areas in China. We first embarked on an exploratory analysis (March 2012) to understand the ToV program from the perspectives of nanostore owners, the ToV's CPG suppliers, and the government. We then collected interview data. InPeriod 1(2013–2014), when the technology was still nascent, we found that nanostore owner's trust in the ToV's CPG suppliers, and system value, played key roles for nanostore owners to use the ToV procurement system. InPeriod 2(2018–2019), three contextual factors emerged—population demographic shift, improved technology infrastructure, and trust in new [non-ToV] purchasing platforms—each hindering the ToV procurement system's use. We observed strong government support during the early phases of ToV, but that support evolved from subsidizing the ToV platform and offering associated training (Period 1), to also providing credibility to competing non-ToV procurement platforms (Period 2). Collectively, the findings identify idiosyncratic challenges that arise when public policies attempt to address developing region problems by reengineering supply chains via IT. We provide implications for IT research about technology management in rural developing areas and for managers to recognize potential pitfalls of managing IT projects in supply bases unfamiliar with advanced IT."
The impact of waiting on customer-instigated service time: Field evidence from a live-chat contact center,Noyan Ilk,26 June 2022,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1199,"AbstractIt is well known that the waiting time a customer experiences in a service system is determined by the service processing time of preceding customers, among other factors. We argue that a directionally opposite effect, which diffuses from waiting time to her own service time, also exists in co-productive service contexts where a significant fraction of the service time is contributed by the customer. Multiple underlying customer behavioral mechanisms lead us to hypothesize that waiting's impact is dependent on the service stage and magnifies as the service process approaches completion. Our empirical analysis uses a unique operational data set that combines server log information with instant-messaging transcripts collected from a live-chat contact center. We show that pre-service waiting accelerates customer engagement—one dimension of customer instigated service time—only at the beginning of the conversation and then exhibits a slowdown effect as the conversation proceeds. In contrast, in-service waiting consistently slows down customer responses—another dimension of customer instigated service time, the magnitude of which is higher in later episodes of the agent-customer message exchanges. We discuss the practical implications of our findings on operational policies employed in contact centers."
Bespoke supply-chain resilience: The gap between theory and practice,Morris Cohen,26 May 2022,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1184,"AbstractRecent research has documented that companies are pursuing a variety of strategies to enhance supply-chain resilience. This paper examines how managers actually think about resilience strategies, and then analyzes the relationship between operations, supply-chain characteristics, and the implemented strategies. We define a “Triple-P” framework that matches resilience strategies to supply-chain archetypes by examiningProduct,Partnership, andProcess complexity based on interviews of senior supply-chain executives. These interviews revealed two major influencers of resilience strategy, that is,Homogeneity of internal supply-chain processesandIntegration with other actors in their end-to-end supply chains. We found that the supply chains have different resilience requirements, have different ways to achieve resilience (which we conceptualize as “bespoke supply-chain resilience”), and face different obstacles to resilience. This study aims at initiating a dialogue between supply-chain scholars and practitioners to support more research for developing an effective supply-chain resilience strategy."
Supply chain transparency: Consumer reactions to incongruent signals,Diane A. Mollenkopf,13 April 2022,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1180,"AbstractIn response to consumers' growing interest in how products are sourced, produced, and distributed, organizations are increasingly transparent about their supply chain sustainability practices. Supply chain transparency (SCT) efforts are intended to signal positive information about the company to consumers but the benefits are often unclear, especially when consumers receive multiple, but mixed signals that include negative events. We draw on signaling theory to explore how consumers develop impressions of a company's products based on different evaluative dimensions: the positive integrity signal of SCT and the negative capability signal of a product recall. The incongruent signal set creates ambiguity for consumers in assessing product quality and subsequent purchase decisions. We develop two scenario-based experiments to test aspects of interdimensional signal incongruence. Experiment 1 investigates the magnitude of signal incongruity by considering combinations of different levels of SCT and product recall severity. Experiment 2 investigates the temporal effect of the incongruent signals, considering the restorative effect of SCT after a product recall signal has been received. While product recall signals are salient for consumers in shaping perceptions of product quality and purchase intentions across both experiments, we demonstrate the strategic value of SCT as a positive integrity signal to consumers."
Opportunistic innovation in the age of digital services,Seongkyoon Jeong,19 April 2022,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1181,"AbstractThis study is about competitive dynamics surrounding opportunistic innovation in the digital supply chain (i.e., on-line gaming, multi-media broadcasting, etc.). When a digital service firm falls short of delivering required services, consumers look for alternative service offerings. For competing firms, potential demand is created suddenly, and they are compelled to innovate to capture this opportunity. This innovation response occurs in reaction to a service failure, and we call it opportunistic innovation. We characterize opportunistic innovation as being situational and temporal—the opportunity is created by the failure of another firm, and it is taken up by the fast-responding firms. The goal of this study is to develop a theory of opportunistic innovation and empirically examine its presence and associated constructs. We have compiled the daily usage-and-update history of 460 online gaming services between 2014 and 2017 and their 58 major service failure events. Our results confirm the temporal and situational characteristics of opportunistic innovation. Firms with alternative services quickly introduce innovation to the market shortly after a service failure when the readiness for convertibility at competing firms is high. In addition, results suggest that opportunistic innovation is constrained by the resource congestion on the supplier side in the digital supply chain."
The role of communication style in adaptation to interorganizational project disruptions,Nuno Oliveira,11 May 2022,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1183,"AbstractInterorganizational projects often suffer disruptions that require participating organizations to adapt in order to restore project operations. We study the role of communication style in facilitating adaptation to such disruptions. Whereas the literature on interorganizational communication has emphasized communication mode and frequency, we study the content and features of written communication in seven U.K. construction projects. Communication style mattered for adaptation quality in these projects, and we found that several properties of communication style were particularly important for adaptation: cost and information orientation, as well as informality, precision and authenticity. Moreover, managerial slack and organizational reputation were important precursors of communication style. These results provide novel insights into the role of communication style in adaptation to interorganizational project disruptions. We discuss the implications of these insights for research on interorganizational projects in operations and supply chain management."
Supplier inventory leanness and financial performance,Jordan M. Barker,20 May 2022,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1185,"AbstractNumerous studies have examined the relationship between inventory management and financial performance. However, the focus of such empirical work has primarily been on how a firm's own inventory characteristics affect its performance. Our objective is to extend this body of literature beyond the firm-level. We draw on inventory theory and resource-based theories to hypothesize about the effect of supplier inventory leanness on a focal firm's financial performance and how supplier and focal firm inventory leanness interact to affect such outcomes. We test our hypotheses using a large panel dataset of supplier-focal firm relationships obtained from Compustat's Customer Segment database and aggregated to the focal firm-quarter level, as well as firm financial information from Compustat's Fundamentals Quarterly database. The econometric analyses provide evidence that supplier inventory leanness influences focal firm financial performance indirectly through the interaction with the firm's own inventory leanness. In particular, our estimation results detail how supplier inventory leanness affects the non-linearity of the focal firm's inventory leanness-financial performance relationship and its optimal inventory leanness level. The findings broaden the scope of empirical inventory literature and highlight supplier inventory leanness as an important consideration in firm-level inventory decision making."
What servicizing demands of a company: The need for inter-functional coordination,Akshay Mutha,01 May 2022,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1182,"AbstractOEMs of capital-intensive products are increasingly servicizing their business model, that is, they lease the product to the customer while selling the service. This has led to the forward and reverse flow of products and information between the OEMs and customers. The standard practices and processes of the traditional sell-a-product model do not apply to the servicizing business model. We draw upon our experience with two servicizing OEMs and highlight the inter-functional coordination and development of new business processes needed for OEMs to successfully manage the transition from selling the product to selling the service. Specifically, we discuss the interconnected nature of the business strategy, product development, supply chain, and accounting and finance functions in managing a servicizing business model. Along with close coordination in the strategic dimensions, OEMs also need to make changes in their operational processes to manage the return flow of multiple usecycle products to profitably remanufacture them and re-lease to customers. When operational changes are implemented correctly, the servicizing model also offers several benefits that are not present in the traditional sell-a-product business model."
The design sourcing choice and technological performance in the upscale and downscale markets of an architectural innovation,Woo-Yong Park,17 January 2022,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1168,"AbstractIn this study, we investigate the performance impacts of design sourcing choices in addressing an architectural innovation from its originating market to subsequent markets. We maintain that the effects of design internalization and externalization on the technological performance of firms' products may vary across the originating and subsequent markets with different requisite technological demands due to the dynamics of knowledge spillovers and knowledge exchange hazards in those markets. We hypothesize that design internalization is likely to outperform design externalization when facing an architectural innovation in a subsequent upscale market with a higher technological performance requisite than in the originating market. The case is then reverse in a subsequent downscale market with a lower technological performance requisite. We test our hypotheses in the empirical contexts of the US bicycle markets in which the index gear-shifting technology (i.e., an architectural innovation) originated in the road bicycle market in 1985 and subsequently traversed to the mountain bicycle market (i.e., an upscale market) in 1987 and the city bicycle market (i.e., a downscale market) in 1988. The results are largely in line with our hypotheses. The contributions of our study to the current literature as well as its managerial implications are also discussed."
The impact of chief risk officer appointments on firm risk and operational efficiency,Huashan Li,16 March 2022,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1175,"AbstractTo exercise risk control at the corporate level, firms often appoint Chief Risk Officers (CROs) to their top management team. By establishing CRO positions, firms can reduce firm risk and potential financial losses caused by operational disruptions. Yet, by inducing stringent control measures on risks, security, and compliance, CRO appointments might create unwieldy bureaucracies with operational hurdles and incur burdensome costs that offset efficiency. Using longitudinal secondary data collected from multiple sources, we analyze the impact of CRO appointments on firm risk and operational efficiency of 435 publicly listed firms in the United States from 2006 to 2016. Our results indicate that CRO appointments not only reduce risks, but also improve efficiency in operations. We delve into the power of CROs and find that more powerful CROs are more effective in enhancing the operational efficiency of firms. We further examine the contextual factors and reveal that firms operating under high industry litigation threats and industry dynamism improve operational efficiency to a greater extent after CRO appointments. Overall, CROs' appointments are more beneficial to firms when they have stronger power in the top management team and when the operating environments are uncertain and volatile."
The moderating influence of supplier culture on the relationship between buyer power and supplier shirking,Keith Skowronski,03 April 2022,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1178,"AbstractGlobalization has added a layer of complexity to the challenge of mitigating opportunism in buyer–supplier relationships. When engaging with suppliers in different countries, buyers must manage relationships across various cultures. Prior empirical research has shown that inter-firm power affects opportunism in exchange relationships, and conceptual studies suggest that national culture is a location characteristic that could influence inter-firm power. However, no research has empirically examined the efficacy of inter-firm power in controlling opportunism, or other exchange outcomes, across different cultural contexts. To study this relevant issue, we investigate how a supplier's national culture influences the effectiveness of two bases of inter-firm power, coercive and expert power, on a form of opportunism that has been anecdotally observed in practice—supplier shirking. We utilize primary dyadic data on 109 outsourcing relationships and secondary data of supply chain location characteristics to examine this phenomenon. We find that the effects of inter-firm power on shirking vary across suppliers in different cultures and that, in certain cultures, coercive power may reduce the effectiveness of expert power. Our results show that manufacturers must explicitly consider suppliers' national culture when managing a globally dispersed supply base or risk encountering supplier shirking."

Group-level information decay and inventory inspection: An empirical-analytical approach,Howard Hao-Chun Chuang,04 January 2022,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1167,"AbstractDespite numerous optimization techniques proposed to address inventory record inaccuracy (IRI), there continues to be a lack of empirical appreciation of IRI, nor do existing item-level inspection policies accommodate managerial needs for allocating inspection effort to groups of items. We address these issues by collaborating with a retailer to collect archival data and develop statistical estimation and practical optimization techniques that address IRI. We propose a continuous-time model to explain group-level information decay and, based on the model's structure, develop an inspection policy that satisfies managerial needs for allocating inspection effort to a group of items. After analyzing model behavior and quantifying unobservable cost factors using information readily available, we test the efficacy of the proposed policy within the retailing environment and find it to outperform both the retailer's inspection routines and a well-established industry benchmark. Finally, we illustrate how to optimize grouping and inspection decisions jointly and show potential benefits from optimized group formation. Our empirically grounded modeling effort yields transferable methods and generalizable insights for improving inventory integrity."
Accounting for cross-location technological heterogeneity in the measurement of operations efficiency and productivity,Emir Malikov,14 December 2021,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1166,"AbstractMotivated by the long-standing interest in understanding the role of location for firm performance, this paper provides a semiparametric methodology to accommodate locational heterogeneity in production analysis. Our approach is novel in that we explicitly model spatial variation in parameters in the production-function estimation. We accomplish this by allowing both the input-elasticity and productivity parameters to be unknown functions of the firm's geographic location and estimate them via local kernel methods. This allows the production technology to vary across space, thereby accommodating neighborhood influences on firm production. In doing so, we are also able to examine the role of cross-location differences in explaining the variation in operational productivity among firms. Our model is superior to the alternative spatial production-function formulations because it (i) explicitly estimates the cross-locational variation in production functions, (ii) is readily reconcilable with the conventional production axioms and, more importantly, (iii) can be identified from the data by building on the popular proxy-variable methods, which we extend to incorporate locational heterogeneity. Using our methodology, we study China's chemicals manufacturing industry and find that differences in technology (as opposed to in idiosyncratic firm heterogeneity) are the main source of the cross-location differential in total productivity in this industry."
Improving care transitions with standardized peer mentoring: Evidence from intervention based research using randomized control trial,Yeojun Chun,17 January 2022,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1170,"AbstractWe investigate how patients can co-create value when transitioning care between the hospital and home after a major life altering surgery such as kidney transplant. Collaborating with health care providers at a large U.S. hospital, we adopted an intervention-based research approach to develop a standardized peer-mentoring program where former patients mentor current patients for 30 days postdischarge. We assessed the impact of the program on patient anxiety and 30-day readmissions through a randomized control trial that recruited 80 transplant patients. Our analyses of patient anxiety indicated that patients in the treatment arm experienced 3.42 points greater decrease in anxiety score over 30 days, suggesting that care transitions using mentors decreases anxiety levels among patients. Our analyses of readmissions led to an unexpected but explainable result. We found that patients in the treatment arm were at 12.6 times greater risk of readmission during the first 30 days. Exploratory analysis suggests that increased readmission may have been due to patients reporting complications sooner, which allowed them to get treated earlier. Overall, our study informs healthcare operations on how to design effective transition of care programs using cost-effective resources and offers new insights on using patient-centric metrics."
Should firms use digital work instructions?—Individual learning in an agile manufacturing setting,Peter Letmathe,07 October 2021,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1159,"AbstractNew technological innovations in robotics, automation, and digitization enable agile manufacturing, smaller lot sizes, and quicker changes to the product and the production process. In such environments, learning is important, since workers must learn new tasks and adapt to frequent changes quickly. In an experimental study, we compare digital work instructions with traditional paper-based ones, the latter still being common in today's quality management systems. Our analysis is based on subjects working in the demonstration factory of a large German university in a realistic work environment; it, therefore, guarantees high internal and external validity. We show that digitally animated, interactive work instructions are an effective way to foster faster learning and enhanced performance when new manufacturing tasks are being carried out. Our results indicate that a combination of digital and traditional paper-based instructions does not yield any advantages over a sole reliance on digital learning."

Reference-dependent preferences in flat penalty service-level contracts,Jose Benedicto Duhaylongsod,10 April 2023,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1251,"AbstractThis paper investigates a supply chain governed by a flat penalty service-level contract in which missing the target fill rate can lead to costly operational disruption. We focus on near-miss bias: (1) the preference for near-miss events, that is, risky production quantities that reach the target but narrowly avoid disruption; and (2) riskier decision-making due to such preferences. We propose a reference-dependent behavioral model that explains the near-miss bias. The findings of a laboratory experiment show that production quantities are evaluated based on realized profits and are below the optimal model prediction. Contracts associated with lower perceived severity, that is, the ratio of flat penalty to wholesale price, result in lower production quantities than those with higher perceived severity, even though the standard model does not predict any effect. A structural estimation analysis indicates that the behavioral model performs better than the standard model in terms of predictive accuracy and goodness of fit. Our analysis provides insights for managers who design supply chain contracts in settings with considerable risk of disruption due to a shortage of critical parts."
Consignment inventory shrinkage in general and physician preference medical supplies: An empirically-grounded analytical investigation,Claudia Rosales,13 June 2023,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1256,"AbstractThe cost of medical supplies represents a significant portion of hospital spending. Hospitals manage different types of medical supplies, such as general medical supplies and physician preference items. General medical supplies tend to be numerous and relatively low cost, while physician preference items tend to be less numerous and more expensive. Strong physician preference for certain medical supplies can limit the options available to reduce inventory costs. The use of consignment inventory is one way in which hospitals seek to reduce inventory costs for both general supplies as well as physician preference items. However, the use of consignment reduces the level of oversight that hospitals have on consigned inventories, thereby potentially increasing the likelihood of shrinkage. The impact of consignment on shrinkage cost has received limited attention. We investigate this issue by drawing upon the precepts of agency theory and by analyzing hospital data that span multiple years. Our results suggest that the use of consignment increases shrinkage and spend. We develop empirically informed analytical models to better understand the impact of an unforeseen increase in shrinkage on the cost associated with general and physician preference items. The analytical investigation suggests that the impact on general and physician preference items differ depending on the type of consignment contract negotiated between a hospital and a vendor. We discuss the theoretical and managerial implications of our findings."
Negative externality on service level across priority classes: Evidence from a radiology workflow platform,Saman Lagzi,04 May 2023,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1252,"AbstractWe study the potential negative impact of imbalanced compensation schemes on firm performance. We analyze data from a radiology workflow platform that connects off-site radiologists with hospitals. These radiologists select tasks from a common pool, while service level is defined by priority-specific turnaround time targets. However, imbalances between pay and workload of different tasks could result in higher priority tasks with low pay-to-workload ratio receiving poorer service. We investigate this hypothesis, showing turnaround time is decreasing in pay-to-workload for lower priority tasks, whereas it is increasing in workload for high-priority tasks. Crucially, we find evidence of an externality effect: Having many economically attractive tasks with low priority can lead to longer turnaround times for higher priority tasks, increasing their likelihood of delay, thus partially defeating the purpose of the priority classes."
The signaling effect of supplier's customer network instability on service price: Insights from the container shipping charter market,Pankaj Kumar,26 April 2023,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1254,"AbstractIn a service exchange setting, the supply management literature generally assumes, with notable exceptions, the availability of complete information regarding supplier reliability. Highlighting the information asymmetry in supplier evaluation and using signaling theory, we argue that for a focal buyer, a supplier's downstream ego-network instability, that is, other buyers' turnover in a supplier's network from one period to the next, acts as asignalof supplier unreliability, thereby reducing the price that the buyer pays to the supplier in a service exchange. Furthermore, we suggest that focal buyer–supplier relationship strength and structural equivalence weaken the negative effect of instability because the buyer has a more direct and positive experience with the supplier. Using a dataset of 3263 unique dyads formed by 260 buyers (shipoperators) and 493 suppliers (shipowners) during the 2000–2018 period in the container shipping charter market, we find support for our hypotheses, except for the contingent effect of structural equivalence. Our study contributes to signaling literature and network research by developing a supplier's downstream ego-network instability as a salient heuristic for a focal buyer's pricing decisions. These findings equip buyer managers who may not accurately foresee supplier service quality in the charter market with a new supplier evaluation tool: a supplier's downstream ego-network instability."
Can mass customization slow fast fashion down? The impact on time-to-disposal and willingness-to-pay,Aydin Alptekinoglu,03 May 2023,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1255,"AbstractWe experimentally investigate whether mass customization enhances sustainability and firm outcomes in a fast fashion context. Fast fashion delivers fashion trends to consumers quickly and cheaply but has detrimental effects on the environment (e.g., waste accumulation, water pollution). To mitigate these harmful effects, we examine how different points of customer involvement in mass customization affect the anticipated number of months to product disposal and willingness-to-pay for mass-customized products. We employ a series of experiments and find that consumer perceptions of the degree of customization increase as the point of customer involvement shifts upstream fromUsetoAssemblytoFabricationtoDesignand that the anticipated number of months to disposal and willingness-to-pay increase as the point of customer involvement shifts upstream toDesign. We also find that the implementation of customer involvement in mass customization matters. Overall, these results provide evidence that mass customization viaDesignmay not only helpslowfast fashion down, which has major sustainability implications, but it may also present a win-win opportunity for both the environmentandfirms (in terms of the bottom line—provided, of course, that it does not have any major cost disadvantages)."
Vulnerability diffusions in software product networks,Martin Kang,16 July 2023,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1270,"AbstractDuring software product development, the combination of digital resources (such as application programming interfaces and software development kits) establishes loose and tight edges between nodes, which form a software product network (SPN). These edges serve as observable conduits that may help practitioners and researchers better understand how vulnerabilities diffuse through SPNs. We apply network theory to analyze data from over 12 years of records extracted from the National Vulnerability Database. We contribute novel measures established using machine learning to gauge the properties influencing vulnerability diffusion within an SPN. We observed an SPN having a discernable shape that changed over time via network updates. We propose hypotheses and find empirical evidence that vulnerability diffusion is influenced by edge dynamics, developer responses, and their interaction. Implications for practice are that increased developer responses reduce software vulnerability diffusion attributed to edge dynamics."

The bright side of trust-less relationships: A dyadic investigation of the role of trust congruence on supplier knowledge acquisition across borders,Lei Wang,18 January 2023,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1235,"AbstractTrust is considered essential to interfirm knowledge acquisition across borders. However, recent studies indicate that interfirm collaboration can thrive even in low trust situations. This study proposes that low trust can facilitate supplier knowledge acquisition (SKA) across borders if it is aligned with the other party's trust. Rather than high trust from a single party, trust congruence—similar levels of trust from buyers and suppliers regardless of their levels—may be more predictive of successful knowledge acquisition across borders. We further propose that different types of trust congruence have distinct effects on SKA across borders. Last, we propose that the influence of trust congruence on SKA is conditional on the presence of effective knowledge appropriability mechanisms (KAMs) and institutional distance between buyer and supplier home countries in cross-border transactions. Data are collected from 648 managers working for 162 matched dyads of manufacturing suppliers in China and buyers from 24 OECD countries. The findings support the propositions and suggest that supply chain managers should pay attention to aligning trust levels with their partners in cross-border transactions, and especially do so when lacking effective KAMs and when buyers and suppliers are from similar institutional environments."
Network orchestration in a large inter-organizational project,Jens K. Roehrich,07 February 2023,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1237,"AbstractMultiple organizations working jointly on shared activities in inter-organizational projects for a defined period of time are used increasingly to coordinate the supply of complex products, subsystems, and services across many industries. Despite the growth in inter-organizational networks as an organizational form, scholars have only recently begun to identify how lead organizations orchestrate the coordination of multiple parties with disparate goals, responsibilities, and capabilities. Prior work offers limited insights into the choice of network governance forms, and how coordination is undertaken by the network orchestrator to govern these networks. We conducted a longitudinal study of four networks to deliver vital services into a large project. We identified how the choice of network governance form was based on task complexity. A shared governance form was chosen for networks developed to deliver routine services, whereas a lead organization governance form was chosen for networks set up to deliver complex services. However, findings showed that the selection of an appropriate governance form was not sufficient for ensuring high performance. The network orchestrator's mode of coordination (formal or informal), the intensity of coordination (active or passive), and fit with the form of governance form (shared or lead organization governed) was important in driving performance."
The influence of home shopping television network impulse buying on product shortages,Sangjoon Lee,22 February 2023,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1238,"AbstractThis study investigates the relationship between impulse buying and product shortages in the context of television home shopping. Home shopping networks adopt promotional tactics to pitch sales and even encourage consumers' impulse buying. Marketing and sales management often assume that home shoppers' impulse buying will increase sales and profits, not considering the possibility that a significant number of impulse purchases could be canceled or returned. In general, product shortages driven by consumers' impulse buying may create a phantom stockout condition whereas non-impulsive consumers are deprived of purchasing opportunities while products are in the process of being canceled or returned. This is the first large-scale empirical study that addresses the relationship between impulse buying and product shortages in a network retail context. Based on actual transaction data, a novel research plan is developed to measure the impact of consumers' impulse buying on the retailer's revenue and product shortages. The findings indicate that impulse buying may cause product shortages directly. We conduct a post hoc analysis to investigate the differences in the impact of impulse buying between newly introduced and existing products and between hedonic and utilitarian products. Based on the empirical findings, we provide managerial implications for home shopping network retailers."
The impact of nurse staffing on turnover and quality: An empirical examination of nursing care within hospital units,Xiaosong (David) Peng,26 March 2023,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1245,"AbstractInadequate nurse staffing continues to challenge healthcare delivery in the United States. In this research, we undertake a fine-grained, unit-level analysis to understand the relationships between nurse staffing, nurse turnover, and pressure ulcers, the latter of which is a key nursing-sensitive care quality indicator. We examine these relationships within two types of hospital units: intensive care units (ICUs) and medical-surgical (MedSurg) units, which have unique patient mixes and needs. Using hospital unit-level data between 2008 and 2017, we show that nurse staffing primarily affects nurse turnover in ICUs, and that the adverse effects of nurse turnover on care quality tend to be stronger in ICUs than in MedSurg units. These findings provide important theoretical insights into the varying roles of staffing, turnover, and quality across organizational units. The findings suggest that hospital administrators may prioritize staffing needs for ICUs over MedSurg units to maintain strong quality performance on measures such as pressure ulcers. Further, our study reveals that staffing requirements for ICUs may be inadequate compared with MedSurg units. Thus, there is a need to evaluate existing guidelines on ICU staffing."
Hospital and surgeon experience and patient health outcomes after coronary artery bypass graft surgery,Jingyun Li,27 March 2023,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1247,"AbstractThe Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program imposes financial penalties on hospitals with excess readmission rates for various conditions, including coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. While prior research has focused mainly on hospital-specific factors and their impact on patient mortality, surgeon risk factors and patient outcomes, such as readmission risk, have received less attention. We study three drivers of CABG readmission risk—hospital and surgeon case volume, variation in surgeon volume, and surgeon familiarity with hospitals. Drawing on unique patient data sets of CABG surgeries spanning 3 years, we study the relationships between hospital and surgeon case volume, readmission risk, and postoperative length of stay (PLOS). We find evidence of an inverted U-shaped relationship between case volume and readmission risk and a U-shaped relationship with PLOS. Our results also indicate that surgeon volume variation moderates the relationship between surgeon volume and readmission risk, where readmission risk increases with greater variation in surgeon volume. We observe that the impact of surgeon experience on readmission risk at the focal hospital outweighs their experience at other hospitals. Our study has significant implications for hospital resource management as it highlights the role of surgeon and hospital experience in improving patient outcomes after CABG surgery."
A reinforcement learning approach for hotel revenue management with evidence from field experiments,Ji Chen,15 March 2023,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1246,"AbstractWe consider a budget hotel chain's revenue management problem of deciding how to dynamically allocate capacity to multiple segments of customers. Our work solves an industrial-sized problem faced by practitioners, with the reality of implementation motivating us to develop a tailored reinforcement learning approach. Our approach proceeds in two steps. First, a recommended average discount is computed with a reinforcement learning algorithm. Then, the recommended average discount is turned into a capacity allocation through a linear program. This approach overcomes the challenges of characterizing demand and estimating cancellations, and it facilitates hotel managers' acceptance of the revenue management system. We implement this approach in the hotel chain in a pilot study and assess its effectiveness using synthetic control methods. Our approach improves the key operational performance measure—revenue per available room—by 11.80%. There is heterogeneity in how the pilot hotels improve their revenue per available room. Some mainly increase their occupancy rate, some mainly increase the average daily room rate, while others experience significant increases in both. Further analysis shows that our approach uncovers the individual sources of suboptimal performance in pilot hotels and correspondingly improves decision-making. Our work demonstrates that a reinforcement learning approach for hotel revenue management is promising."
Justice in time: A theory of constraints approach,Shany Azaria,08 January 2023,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1234,"AbstractIf there is some truth to the adage that justice must not only be done, but must be seen to be done, then surely it must be seen to be done in a timely manner. Yet court congestion and delays – which threaten to undermine the justice system – have become global phenomena with significant adverse implications for social welfare, economic development, and civil rights. This work describes an application of the Theory of Constraints (TOC) to the judicial system for the purpose of designing an intervention to alleviate court congestion – an intervention that won the 2012 Goldratt Foundation New Knowledge Award. In cooperation with the Jerusalem District Court in Israel, the judicial process was reviewed through the lens of TOC, and a set of operational changes was implemented to reduce case processing time. Data collected before and after this intervention indicate the potential of achieving lead-time reduction by applying TOC to judicial environments."

Hybrid digital manufacturing: Capturing the value of digitalization,Andreas Stark,21 December 2022,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1231,"AbstractA chasm is growing between the advanced technologies available for improving manufacturing operations and those effectively used in practice. The vision of Industry 4.0 is to mobilize industry to seek out these possibilities for improvement and to close the gap between opportunity and reality. However, when compared with more established improvement opportunities such as lean manufacturing, the digitalization of manufacturing lacks in both paradigmatic examples and an understanding of how to achieve the benefits. This lack is a complication of concern: Without an appropriate operations strategy to capture the value of digitalization, manufacturing companies will be unable to focus on technological investments and operational changes. To address this concern, operations management academics must develop new theory through active engagement in the practice of digitalization in manufacturing. This research presents a paradigmatic example, based on engaged scholarship, focused on effectively combining novel object-interactive and conventional manufacturing syntax for benefiting from digitalization in internal operations and the wider supply chain. The contribution to literature is a novel operations strategy—hybrid digital manufacturing—for capturing the value of Industry 4.0 technologies."
"Reengineering professional services through automation, remote outsourcing, and task delegation",Scott E. Sampson,24 June 2023,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1268,"AbstractDigital technology has enabled significant productivity gains in many industries. Manufacturers have benefited from robotics, and service businesses have benefited from self-service technologies. An area that has seen only meager productivity gains is professional services, such as healthcare, consulting, legal services, and higher education. Despite the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and other new technologies, professional services continue to be labor intensive with high labor costs. In 2021, Sampson published an empirically-based framework suggesting that emerging technologies would allow professional services to improve productivity by automating some tasks with self-service technologies, outsourcing some tasks to remote professionals, and delegating some tasks to semiprofessional workers. The underlying theory was that this restructuring hinges on the creative and interpersonal skill requirements of various tasks. Our research builds on Sampson's framework by modeling a professional service operation and studying the influence of task offloading on costs and quality. Our model involves discrete event simulation parameterized by empirical data. We consider labor costs, managerial costs, delay costs (including customer balking), and assessment costs. Results show contexts wherein increased task offloading can reduce costs with negligible impact on quality, suggesting great opportunities for reengineering professional services through increased automation, offshore outsourcing, and task delegation."
How deadline orientation and architectural modularity influence software quality and job satisfaction,Thomas Kude,14 February 2023,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1230,"AbstractThe implementation of digital transformation programs requires careful allocation of software developers to a variety of digital products and services with different levels of modularity. This paper investigates how deadline orientation (an individual-level preference of developers for completing work close to deadlines) and architectural modularity (a characteristic of products) influence central outcomes in software development. We argue that architectural modularity positively interacts with deadline orientation to influence software quality and the job satisfaction of developers. Our empirical analyses, using rare and high-quality data from 131 software developers and 29 product owners working at a captive software development center in India of a leading global software firm, confirm our hypotheses. We contribute to the literature on software development by showing that the fit between the technological characteristics of the software product (i.e., architectural modularity) and people factors (i.e., the temporal work style preferences of developers) plays an important role in shaping both software quality and job satisfaction. Our study has wider implications for the literature on software development, temporal work styles, and architectural modularity. It is instructive for practitioners tasked with hiring or allocating software developers for software products with varying technological characteristics in their digital transformation efforts."
Demand planning for the digital supply chain: How to integrate human judgment and predictive analytics,Rebekah Brau,15 May 2023,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1257,"AbstractOur research examines how to integrate human judgment and statistical algorithms for demand planning in an increasingly data-driven and automated environment. We use a laboratory experiment combined with a field study to compare existing integration methods with a novel approach: Human-Guided Learning. This new method allows the algorithm to use human judgment to train a model using an iterative linear weighting of human judgment and model predictions. Human-Guided Learning is more accurate vis-à-vis the established integration methods of Judgmental Adjustment, Quantitative Correction of Human Judgment, Forecast Combination, and Judgment as a Model Input. Human-Guided Learning performs similarly to Integrative Judgment Learning, but under certain circumstances, Human-Guided Learning can be more accurate. Our studies demonstrate that the benefit of human judgment for demand planning processes depends on the integration method."
Impact of working capital on firm performance: Does IT matter?,Palash Deb,14 March 2023,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1244,"AbstractAlthough prior research in operations management has explored the working capital—firm performance relationship, the results from these studies remain inconclusive, with studies finding positive, curvilinear, or even insignificant relationships. This is largely due to contingent factors that make this relationship both complex and idiosyncratic. To strengthen the beneficial effect of working capital on performance, firms must therefore make appropriate investments that would foster more objective, informed, and firm-specific working capital choices. This article examines one such investment, namely in information technology (IT), that can allow firms to optimize the working capital–firm performance relationship. This is important, as the role of IT in this relationship is yet to be explored. Using proprietary IT data from the Harte Hanks database, and based on a sample of 1,054 US-based manufacturing firms during 2011–2013, we find that IT investment positively moderates the performance effects of inventory, payables, and receivables cycles, and that these moderating effects vary by the type of IT investment, namely IT infrastructure and IT labor. Drawing on the theory of the Smart Machine, we explain how IT infrastructure and IT labor perform distinct roles that can helpautomate(i.e., use technology to increase the speed and accuracy of process execution) and/orinformate(i.e., use technology to create new information), thereby moderating the working capital–firm performance relationship. We argue and find evidence that, due to the largely transactional nature of working capital processes, IT infrastructure has a relatively stronger moderating effect on performance than IT labor."
"We can work it out: A multilevel examination of relationships among group and individual technology workarounds, and performance",Shaobo Wei,26 July 2023,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1267,"AbstractDespite the operational nature of enterprise system (ES) implementation and use, individual employees or work groups may deploy technology workarounds to circumvent inflexibility in or obstacles to using the ES. However, our understanding of the multilevel nature of technology workarounds and their performance implications remains limited. Drawing upon the multilevel theory of system usage and adaptive structuration theory, the current study examines the conditions under which group technology workarounds affect group performance, individual technology workarounds, and individual performance. Based on two studies with different research designs, we find that group technology workarounds have distinctive effects on short- and on long-term group performance. Specifically, while the impact of group technology workarounds on group performance is significantly positive in the short term, such effect diminishes over time. System failure and competition intensity strengthen the positive effect of group technology workarounds on short-term performance, whereas system failure and task nonroutineness lessen the negative effect of group technology workarounds on long-term performance. Our study further confirms the multilevel nature of technology workarounds, finding that group technology workarounds can influence individual technology workarounds and thereby individual performance. Our results support the view that technology workarounds as a group action should be considered alongside individual technology workarounds, as well as their positive and negative effects on both group and individual performance, in both the short- and long-term."
Examining sharing economy operations: A process perspective,Alan Mackelprang,19 June 2023,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1269,
The impact of incumbents' operational and governance responses on the sharing economy: An asset orchestration perspective,Chen Zhang,22 March 2023,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1243,"AbstractLeveraging an asset-sharing operating model, sharing economy platforms have disrupted incumbent firms in many industries. This research draws on the asset orchestration perspective to examine incumbents' asset orchestration (i.e., operational and governance actions) as they respond to threats from the sharing economy and the effectiveness of these actions in curbing a sharing economy firm's performance. We also analyze how the sharing economy firm's competitive moves counteract incumbents' asset orchestration responses. Our longitudinal empirical analysis in the accommodation industry demonstrates that the growth of sharing economy increases incumbent hotels' asset-based operational actions, which reduce the sharing economy's performance. Although incumbents' asset governance actions increase as the local sharing economy grows, they do not seem to hinder sharing economy's performance. This research highlights the role of asset orchestration in the competition between incumbents and the sharing economy and contributes to the operations and sharing economy literature."
Distributed service with proximal capacity and pricing on a two-sided sharing economy platform,Kyungmin (Brad) Lee,27 September 2022,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1222,"AbstractIn this article, we characterize the relationship between spatial pricing and capacity based on distributed service design (DSD) decisions in a two-sided sharing economy platform. We leverage theoretical tenets on two-sided markets and on spatial pricing and capacity management in the sharing economy to inform a set of empirical and simulation models. Empirically, we use data on 156,520 observations of dynamic pricing and capacity distribution within Uber's San Francisco region. Estimation of a spatial econometric model reveals that the number of active drivers in neighboring zones negatively impacts the price in focal zones. Simultaneously, we find that spatial proximity is a significant factor in determining the distribution of prices when service demand levels are sufficiently high. We leverage this simultaneity finding to advance the literature on the sharing economy by incorporating operational considerations such as distributed capacity into service design. We link these econometric results with profit and welfare using a simulation that tests a variety of DSD pricing strategies under varying elasticity and revenue-sharing conditions. Our findings offer guidance to firms managing two-sided sharing economy platforms on tracking demand- and supply side price elasticity levels as well as revenue sharing spread when seeking to maximize profit, welfare, or both."
The institutionalization of sharing economy platforms in China,Dun Li,27 April 2023,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1253,"AbstractRecent past has witnessed a great proliferation of sharing economy platforms with great successes, but also many failures on their journey toward institutionalization, that is, their establishment and acceptance in society. To develop insight on factors contributing to this institutionalization process, this paper relies on the literature in institutional entrepreneurship and investigates sharing economy platforms in China, highlighting institutional voids that are encountered, and suggesting ways on how they can be overcome. These insights are derived through a multiple case study approach involving 61 semi-structured interviews with managers from eight sharing economy platforms (DiDi, Uber China, Huochebang, Yunmanman, OfO, Mobike, Evcard, and Zhida) across four sharing economy industries in China (ride-sharing, logistics-sharing, bike-sharing, and car-sharing). The findings highlight the importance of exchange and collaboration with stakeholders (allies) in the network, as well as the effective response to emerging issues through the adaptation of the business models. In addition, mergers and acquisitions, and the role of government are identified as critical components in aiding platforms in their progression toward institutionalization. Further cognitive, regulative, and normative factors are found to represent valuable institutional pillars that serve as a fertile foundation throughout the institutionalization process. Overall, the findings provide an intriguing insight into the journey of Chinese sharing economy platforms toward institutionalization."
The effects of surge pricing on driver behavior in the ride-sharing market: Evidence from a quasi-experiment,Wei Miao,02 October 2022,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1223,"AbstractSurge pricing has been used to coordinate supply and demand in the ride-sharing industry, but its causal effects on driver behavior remain unclear. This motivates us to examine how surge pricing causally affects driver earnings and labor supply by leveraging a unique quasi-experiment, in which a leading ride-sharing company in China introduced surge pricing in two cities at different times. Using a difference-in-differences design with the causal forest method, we find that surge pricing led to increases in drivers' weekly revenue. Decomposing the weekly revenue into “intensive margin” and “extensive margin” factors, we discover two countervailing effects at play: a cherry-picking effect and a competition effect, and the daily revenue decreased because the latter dominated. Consequently, the increased weekly revenue can be explained by the extensive margin: drivers worked on more days to compensate for the decreased daily revenue, a result consistent with the income targeting behavior. Finally, we examine heterogeneous treatment effects across drivers, and find that surge pricing enticed more part-time drivers to flood the market and crowd out full-time drivers, and that the increase in the drivers' weekly revenue was primarily driven by part-time drivers. Therefore, the benefit of surge pricing was unevenly distributed across drivers."
The cost of convenience: Ridehailing and traffic fatalities,John M. Barrios,12 September 2022,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1221,"AbstractWe examine the effect of the introduction of ridehailing in US cities on fatal traffic accidents. The arrival of ridehailing is associated with an approximately 3% increase in the number of fatal accidents, for both vehicle occupants and pedestrians. Consistent with ridehailing increasing road usage, we find that its introduction is associated with increases in proxies for traffic congestion and with new car registrations. Consistent with a driver quality channel, accident increases are concentrated in ridehailing-eligible vehicles and those with passenger configurations suggestive of ridehailing. Back-of-the-envelope estimates of the annual cost in human lives range from $5.33B to $13.24B. We propose various operational and policy prescriptions for the regulation of ridehailing operations that may help limit such externalities."
A hidden anchor: The influence of service levels on demand forecasts,Behnam Fahimnia,21 December 2022,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1229,"AbstractDemand planning is informed by demand forecasts, service level requirements, replenishment constraints, and revenue projections. “Demand forecasts” differ from “demand plans” in that forecasts only represent the distribution (or the most likely value) of product demand. Motivated by common forecasting practices in industry, our research examines whether forecasters recognize this difference between demand forecasts and demand plans. Based on a lab experiment informed by data from two large FMCG companies, we found that forecasters factor service levels into their demand forecasts, even when they are clearly instructed to predict the most likely demand and incentivized to minimize the forecast error. We establish that this result holds for students and practitioners alike, and show that this behavior is driven by the service level information, and not some other anchor. We use data from a recent industry survey to support the external validity of our key findings."

Technology management in multi-tier chains: A case study of agency in logistics service outsourcing,Henrik Sternberg,14 September 2022,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1219,"AbstractShippers and logistics service providers implement information communication technology (ICT) in outsourced logistics to increase efficiency and remedy information asymmetry. However, the nature of outsourced logistics operations can create technology management challenges due to the organizational distances between the technology initiator and the technology users. Here, we apply the lens of positivist agency theory to study four cases of technology management and agency in multi-tier outsourced logistics services. Our findings suggest that while ICT remedies some information asymmetry, it also creates new information asymmetry—and gives rise to user privacy concerns. Furthermore, the setting of multi-tier subcontracted logistics services appears to be a critical factor in designing governance mechanisms for effective technology management. In addition to our theoretical contributions to technology management in multi-tier outsourcing, we offer an empirical account of agency, proposals for future research, and practical suggestions to help managers tackle agency issues that arise from information asymmetry."
Supplier bottleneck and information dissemination,Meng Li,14 February 2023,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1239,"AbstractThis paper investigates the capacity decisions of complementary suppliers who produce different components of a final product. The suppliers solicit private forecast information from a buyer who has more precise information regarding the market as compared to the suppliers. In this context, the lowest capacity built among suppliers—termed aseffective capacity—represents the bottleneck of a supply chain, which in turn determines the throughput of the entire channel. The standard analysis based on full rationality posits that the capacity decisions of suppliers are based on their prior belief of demand, with no consideration of the buyer's information dissemination or the number of peer suppliers. We test the predictions experimentally, and our laboratory observations reject the prediction of rational model. Then, we develop a behavioral model based on suppliers' heterogeneity in the processing of demand information provided by the buyer. Our behavioral model indicates that suppliers lower their capacity levels when the number of suppliers increases, thereby exacerbating the supplier bottleneck. While the buyer may exaggerate the market demand to ensure abundant supply, interestingly, the inflation can benefit suppliers by increasing their capacity levels. In this manner, the inflation of the buyer can serve to mitigate the supplier bottleneck, thereby resulting in a win–win outcome for both the suppliers and the buyer."
The role of direct equity ownership in supply chains,In-Mu Haw,27 September 2022,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1224,"AbstractThis study examines the effect of direct equity ownership (DO) a buyer holds in its supplier on financial performance and operations of the supplier and buyer. Based on a sample of US buyer–supplier pairs from 1982 to 2017, we find that DO benefits buyer performance, but not supplier performance. The results support the view that DO mainly provides greater control for the buyer. Furthermore, we find that the performance effects of DO are moderated by firm characteristics that engender dependence. The beneficial influence of DO on a buyer's performance is more pronounced when the buyer is more innovative or operates in a more competitive environment. Our examination of the effects of DO on the operations of suppliers and buyers finds that suppliers in buyer–supplier relationships (BSRs) with higher DO invest more in relationship-specific assets (R&D), provide more trade credits, and have lower gross profit margins. Buyers in BSRs with higher DO receive more trade credits and have lower cost of goods sold when the purchases of the buyer from the supplier make up a high proportion of the buyer's cost of goods sold. Overall, these results suggest that DO primarily benefits the buyer at the expense of the supplier, a finding that is consistent with the effects of bargaining and control power of the buyer. We discuss the implications of these findings for practitioners and for extensions to both relational and resource dependence theories."
The impact of poverty on base of the pyramid operations: Evidence from mobile money in Africa,Karthik Balasubramanian,18 December 2022,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1227,"AbstractBusiness models designed to serve those at the “base of the pyramid” are an effective means to create employment and improve quality of life. However, the effect that poverty has on the performance of such businesses is not well-understood. We address this gap through the context of “mobile money,” an electronic currency ecosystem designed as a secure, reliable way for those at the base of the pyramid to store and transfer money. Using data from Kenya and Uganda, and instrumenting for potentially endogenous regressors, we examine the effect poverty has on operational decisions (inventory and price transparency) and market dimensions (network density and demand). Our results suggest that mobile money, as a base of the pyramid business model, is well-positioned to serve those in poverty up to a point, with demand increasing in poverty when the concentration of poverty is sufficiently low. However, our results indicate that, where poverty is more pervasive, inventory costs increase in poverty while per agent demand and agent network density both decrease. In short, the business case for mobile money degenerates in regions where it, arguably, is needed the most. We conclude with thoughts on how to buttress mobile money's business case in these high poverty settings."
Supervised machine learning for theory building and testing: Opportunities in operations management,Yen-Chun Chou,10 January 2023,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1228,"AbstractMachine learning's (ML's) unique power to approximate functions and identify non-obvious regularities in data have attracted considerable attention from researchers in natural and social sciences. The emergence of predictive modeling applications in OM studies notwithstanding, it remains unclear how OM scholars can effectively leverage supervised ML for theory building and theory testing, the primary goals of scientific research. We attempt to fill this gap by conducting a literature review of recent developments in supervised ML in OM to identify vacancies in the extant literature, shedding light on how ML applications can move beyond problem-solving into theory building, and formulating a procedure to help OM scholars leverage ML for exploratory theory development. Our procedure employs the random forest with well-developed properties and inference toolkits that are crucial for empirical research. We then expand the boundary of ML usage and connect supervised ML to the explanatory modeling and hypothesis testing employed by OM empiricists for decades, and discuss the use of supervised ML for causal inference from observational data. We posit that contemporary ML can facilitate pattern exploration and enhance the validity of theory testing. We conclude by discussing directions for future empirical OM studies that aim to leverage ML."
Field experiments in operations management,Yang Gao,14 February 2023,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1240,"AbstractWhile the field experiment is a powerful and well-established method to investigate causal relationships, operations management (OM) has embraced this methodology only in recent years. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the existing OM literature leveraging field experiments. It also serves as a one-stop guide for future application of field experiments in the OM area. We start by recapping the characteristics that distinguish field experiments from other common types of experiments and organizing the relevant OM studies by topic. Corresponding to the commonly overlooked issues in field experiment-based OM studies, we then provide a detailed roadmap, ranging from experimental design and implementation to post-experiment analysis. We further outline the methodological and practical issues as well as corresponding solutions when applying field experiments. We conclude by identifying future research directions from an OM perspective."
Building responsive and resilient supply chains: Lessons from the COVID-19 disruption,Xiang Li,14 April 2023,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1250,
Strengthening supply chain resilience during COVID-19: A case study of JD.com,Zuojun Max Shen,18 October 2021,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1161,"AbstractThe coronavirus/SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) outbreak has caused severe supply chain disruptions in practically all industries worldwide. Online e-commerce platforms, which interact directly with various industries and service numerous consumers, have become remarkable interfaces to observe the impacts of the pandemic on supply chains. Using quantitative operational data obtained from JD.comhttps://www.jd.com., this study analyzes the impact of the pandemic on supply chain resilience, summarizes the challenging scenarios that retailing supply chains experienced in China, and presents the practical response of JD.com throughout the pandemic. To summarize, the pandemic caused exceptional demand and severe logistical disruptions in China, and JD.com has handled well its supply chain management in response based on its integrated supply chain structure and comprehensive intelligent platforms. In particular, the existing intelligent platforms and the delivery procedures were modified slightly but promptly to deal with specific disruptions. Moreover, the entire market scenario in China was effectively controlled through the joint efforts of multiple firms, the government, and the entire Chinese society. Our study provides an example of using practical operational indicators to analyze supply chain resilience, and suggests firms pay attention tooperational flexibilityandcollaboration beyond supply chainsto deal with a large-scale supply chain disruption, such as the COVID-19 outbreak."
Breaking out of the pandemic: How can firms match internal competence with external resources to shape operational resilience?,Yuan Li,25 April 2022,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1176,"AbstractThis study explores how firms sought to effectively match their internal competence with external resources from the supply chain network to improve operational resilience (OR) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Drawing upon matching theory, this study provides an internal–external matching perspective based on flexibility–stability features of OR to explain the operational mechanisms underlying the different matchings between internal flexibility (i.e., product diversity)/stability (i.e., operational efficiency) and external flexibility (i.e., structural holes)/stability (i.e., network centrality). We find that more heterogeneous matchings between internal (external) flexibility and external (internal) stability have a complementary effect that enhances OR, whereas more homogeneous matchings between internal flexibility (or stability) and external flexibility (or stability) have a substitutive effect that reduces OR. This study provides valuable contributions to research focusing on the supply chain, organizational resilience, and operations management."
The impact of governmental COVID-19 measures on manufacturers' stock market valuations: The role of labor intensity and operational slack,Lujie Chen,21 August 2022,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1207,"AbstractThis study investigates the impact of the Chinese government's Level I emergency response policy on manufacturers' stock market values. We empirically examine the roles of human resource dependence (labor intensity) and operational slack within the context of supply chain resilience. Through an event study of 1357 Chinese manufacturing companies, we find that the government's emergency response policy triggered statistically significant positive abnormal returns for manufacturers. However, we also find that there exists a negative impact on abnormal returns for manufacturers that are labor-intensive, giving rise to arguments based in resource dependence theory. In addition, the results indicate the positive role played by operational slack (e.g., financial and inventory slack) in helping manufacturers maintain operations and business continuity, effectively mitigating risks and adding to the manufacturers' resilience. With these findings, we contribute to operations and supply chain management by calling attention to the importance of human resource redundancy while at the same time identifying financial slack and inventory as supply chain resilience strategies that were able to mitigate pandemic-related risks."
Realizing supply chain agility under time pressure: Ad hoc supply chains during the COVID-19 pandemic,Jasmina Müller,18 August 2022,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1210,"AbstractWhen the COVID-19 pandemic began in 2020, the medical product industry faced an unusual demand shock for personal protective equipment (PPE), including face masks, face shields, disinfectants, and gowns. Companies from various industries responded to the urgent need for these potentially life-saving products by adopting ad hoc supply chains in an exceptionally short time: They found new suppliers, developed the products, ramped-up production, and distributed to new customers within weeks or even days. We define these supply chains as ad hoc supply chains that are built for a specific need, an immediate need, and a time-limited need. By leveraging a unique sampling, we examined how companies realize supply chain agility when building ad hoc supply chains. We develop an emergent theoretical model that proposes dynamic capabilities to enable companies building ad hoc supply chains in response to a specific need, moderated by an entrepreneurial orientation allowing firms to leverage dynamic capabilities at short notice and a temporary orientation that increases a company's focus on exploiting the short-term opportunity of ad hoc supply chains."
Working from home and firm resilience to the COVID-19 pandemic,Chunmian Ge,17 July 2022,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1200,"AbstractThe COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted firms' operations. To cope with the crisis, many firms have allowed their employees to work from home (WFH). We examine whether a firm's WFH capacity has increased its resilience during the pandemic. We test the hypotheses using a unique data set that combines listed firms' financial statements, supply chain partners, and job postings on a leading online platform that provides hiring services. We find that imposing COVID-19 anti-contagion policies on firms and their suppliers or customers significantly increases their operating revenue volatility, slows their recovery, and has repercussions on their supply chains. WFH enhances firms' resistance capacity by reducing the effect of COVID-19 on their operating revenue volatility and disruptions to their supply chain partners; however, it also decreases their recovery capacity by extending the time taken to return to normal. Firm attributes, along with workers' occupations, education, and experience, have an impact on the effect of WFH on firm resilience. This study enhances our understanding of shock transmission across supply chains and WFH as a source of firm resilience."
Developing supply chain resilience through integration: An empirical study on an e-commerce platform,Yinan Qi,27 November 2022,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1226,"AbstractThe outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted supply chains and increased the uncertainties faced by firms. While firms are struggling to survive and recover from the pandemic, Chinese e-commerce platforms have demonstrated resilient supply chains. We develop a framework that investigates the impacts of integration between an e-commerce platform and suppliers on supply chain resilience and the moderating effect of the suppliers' product flexibility. An analysis of data from a Chinese e-commerce platform using operational indicators finds that integration between the e-commerce platform and suppliers in terms of information sharing, joint planning and logistics cooperation has positive impacts on supply chain resilience, while procurement automation has the opposite effect. Furthermore, product flexibility positively moderates the impacts of information sharing, joint planning and logistics cooperation. The results enhance current understandings of the factors that contribute to the development of supply chain resilience and reveal that the relationship between integration and resilience should be examined within a contingency framework. The findings also provide guidelines for managers taking measures to mitigate the negative influences of supply chain disruptions."
The effect of customer and supplier concentrations on firm resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic: Resource dependence and power balancing,Shenyang Jiang,24 January 2023,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1236,"AbstractThe COVID-19 pandemic has created significant disruptions in both demand and supply. Our study makes use of such dramatic changes in demand and supply during the pandemic to examine resource dependence and power balancing/unbalancing issues in buyer–supplier relationships. Specifically, we investigate the effect of customer and supplier concentrations on firm resilience during the pandemic. Drawing on resource-dependence theory (RDT), we theorize that shifts in demand and supply in different pandemic stages influence the effect of customer and supplier concentrations on firm resilience by altering the power dynamics between focal firms and their concentrated customers and suppliers. Central to our theorizing is that the worsening power imbalance is more detrimental. Measuring firm resilience by loss and recovery (i.e., change) in productivity, our analysis of 23,440 Chinese listed firms' quarter observations from 2019 to 2020 shows that customer concentration is negatively related to firm resilience in the disruption stage but has no effect in the restoration stage. Supplier concentration is positively related to firm resilience in the disruption stage but undermines firm resilience in the restoration stage. These findings largely confirm our theoretical propositions. We discuss the theoretical and managerial implications."
Advancing the marketing-operations interface in omnichannel retail,Robert Rooderkerk,22 February 2023,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1241,
Omni-channel retailing on platforms: Disentangling the effects of channel integration and inter-platform function usage difference,Jie Fang,04 June 2022,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1186,"AbstractThe rise of omni-channel retailing poses challenges for e-marketplace platforms. To retain third-party sellers in the face of competitive pressure from rivals, e-marketplace platforms are compelled to provide support for online-offline channel integration (OOCI). However, the provision of OOCI support can adversely affect an OOCI-enabled platform's product sales growth by encouraging consumers to switch to brick-and-mortar stores operated by third-party sellers. To ascertain how the OOCI-enabled platform can outperform under such circumstances, we analyzed data on sales of 51,409 products on a dominant Chinese e-marketplace platform as well as inter-platform function usage difference across 209 third-party sellers. Combining propensity score matching with hierarchical linear modeling, we discovered that informational OOCI (e.g., concurrent availability of a product on both online and offline channels) negatively influences the OOCI-enabled platform's product sales growth, whereas the effect of physical OOCI (e.g., the option of store pickup for online purchases) is not significant. Additionally, we found that the three constituent sub-dimensions of third-party sellers' inter-platform function usage difference (i.e., volume difference, category orientation specialization, and uniqueness) moderate the impact of OOCI on the OOCI-enabled platform's product sales growth differently. Findings from this study thus yield actionable guidelines for e-marketplace platforms pursuing omni-channel retailing strategies."
Channel transparency and omnichannel retailing: The impact of sharing retail store product availability information,Xinyi Ren,31 August 2022,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1211,"AbstractAs more firms look to implement omnichannel strategies to mitigate the inherent information barriers between online and offline channels, understanding the outcomes of these initiatives is critical. This study empirically examines the impact of the decision to share brick-and-mortar (B&M) store product availability information with customers, specifically focusing on the scenario where a discrepancy exists in the product assortment of online and offline channels. We investigate the impact of this information sharing strategy on customer research shopping trajectories using a proprietary dataset collected from a leading North American retailer. Using a difference-in-differences approach, we find that this strategy helps boost the overall sales from customers who reside within the trade area of a retail store. At the channel level, the policy induces customers to migrate from the B&M channel to the online channel after learning that the product selection offered at their local retail store may not meet their needs, resulting in a significant increase in online sales, but a slight decrease in B&M sales. From an operational perspective, our empirical evidence suggests that sharing retail store product availability information leads to more customers using the expedited shipping service when shopping online. Furthermore, we also discover a slight increase in the overall return rate. We conclude by providing managerial implications on the functionality of the online and B&M channels and how retailers can coordinate services offered by both channels to improve the utility customers receive from the brand."
Revenue management in a refurbishing duopoly with cannibalization,Nughthoh Arfawi Kurdhi,18 August 2022,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1208,"AbstractRefurbishing has promising economic potential, yet firms remain wary of its potential cannibalization effect on new product sales. Firms need to make strategic choices in competitive settings, involving varying brand strengths and collection constraints. The current study provides an empirical characterization of consumer behavior in such complex settings, which in turn informs an analytical model of optimal pricing policies. The results show that cannibalization (or switching) in a competitive environment has a linear relationship with price discounts, unlike the inverted U-shaped relationship observed in monopolistic settings. The experimental results also highlight the relevance of cross-cannibalization, especially for weaker firms (with low brand value) that compete with stronger firms to sell refurbished products. Our subsequent analytical results reveal how both competitors should adjust their refurbished product prices when internal and cross-cannibalization coefficients change. Weaker firms should focus on surpassing stronger competitors in terms of collection and refurbishing efforts, which implies a predominant focus on operations. Finally, we show that refurbished product prices are a function of, and profits are concave in relation to, the number of core products collected by firms."
From target to actor: Contagion of honesty and deception across buyer–supplier negotiations,Leopold Ried,04 September 2022,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1212,"AbstractUnderstanding negotiators' decision-making processes in buyer–supplier relationships has been of key interest to behavioral operations and supply chain management researchers. We hypothesize that through the exposure to various counterparts in the supply chain network, negotiators' behaviors are influenced by others' behaviors and prone to behavioralcontagion—where the target adopts the behavior he/she is subjected to and exhibits it toward a nonpartisan counterpart. This paper examines such contagion where targets turn into actors of honesty and deception across buyer–supplier negotiations. We analyzed text responses from two studies employing scenario-based negotiation experiments with 350 and 424 individuals with B2B sales experience and tested for the effects of previously received behavior (honesty/deception) and different frequency levels of the received behavior. Our results show contagion effects for honesty and deception in both studies. These effects are largely independent from the frequency with which the behaviors have been received, suggesting that a low stimulus frequency suffices to induce contagion of honest and deceptive behaviors across buyer–supplier negotiations. Interestingly, in contrast to our hypothesized key mechanism based on the extant literature, neither injunctive nor descriptive social norms mediated the relationship between received and acted behaviors. We offer alternative explanations and discuss implications for theory and practice."
Do voluntary environmental programs matter? Evidence from the EPA SmartWay program,Alex Scott,18 August 2022,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1209,"AbstractThere is mixed evidence on the effectiveness of voluntary environmental programs. We evaluate a voluntary program aimed at reducing transportation emissions, that is, the U.S. EPA SmartWay Program. We construct a novel database of the physical assets used by firms before and after they joined SmartWay and compare changes in the age of their assets with that of firms that did not join SmartWay. Our results show that firms that participated in SmartWay operate substantially newer (i.e., cleaner) trucks compared with non-SmartWay participants, indicating that SmartWay participation is a credible signal of a firm's reduced emissions footprint emanating from truck operations. After the start of SmartWay, firms that joined invested in newer trucks relative to firms that did not, with about a year reduction in average truck age several years after the program began. SmartWay had a larger effect on firms that own their trucks compared with firms that outsource ownership, and sustained participation increased the program's effectiveness. We estimate that the SmartWay Program has reduced commercial transportation emissions from operations by 25.2 million metric tons of CO2by increasing the incentive to invest in newer, cleaner trucks. Our study provides insight into factors that make voluntary environmental programs effective."
The inseparable two: Impact of prior success and failure on new product development project discontinuation,Moren Lévesque,30 August 2022,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1214,"AbstractNew product development (NPD) is a risky and expensive endeavor. Therefore, discontinuing less promising NPD projects, based on their development trajectories, is very important, yet firms face challenges when deciding whether and when to discontinue NPD projects. This article examines how characteristics of a firm's prior success and failure experiences, such as the number of launched and discontinued past projects, their attributes (i.e., the codification and quality of the knowledge underlying these past projects), and their level of relatedness (i.e., similarity) to current projects, influence the risks of continuing and discontinuing NPD projects, thus impacting their future discontinuation decisions. We adopt a mixed method approach, where we formally model and empirically test the influence of prior experiences on future decision-making. A formal model enables us to offer reasoning that considers the risks of continuing a project versus discontinuing that project as the basis for theoretical arguments for a set of proposed testable relationships. We then empirically test these relationships on 2938 new drug development projects of biopharma firms worldwide. We find that firms with a greater amount of successandfailure experiences tend to discontinue less promising NPD projects sooner than firms with less success and failure experiences. Also, we find that while the attributes (particularly knowledge codification) of successful experiences predominantly helped firms decide on timely discontinuation, failure experiences influenced firms' decision on timely discontinuation only when the projects were closely related to their failure experiences."

An analysis of operating efficiency and policy implications in last-mile transportation following Amazon's integration,Lina Wang,21 March 2022,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1172,"AbstractWe examine how Amazon's decision to vertically integrate its retail platform and last-mile delivery operations can lead to anti-competitive outcomes as a result of a deterioration in the operating efficiency in the routes served by a last-mile transportation firm. Based on an operational analysis of the last-mile transportation firm, we find that Amazon's decision to vertically integrate increases significantly the mileage necessary to deliver parcels in the ZIP code areas where this integration occurs. Moreover, this increase is significantly amplified by the remoteness and proportion of fast deliveries in these areas. These effects translate, on average, into $1.36 in additional costs necessary to cover extra vehicular and labor expenditures per parcel delivered. Because at the root of these outcomes are interactions among multiple organizations with significant market power asymmetries, we expand on a variety of potential anti-competitive service and pricing outcomes stemming from the impact of Amazon's vertical integration on the last-mile delivery firm's costs. We then put forth different public policy remedies that could be implemented to address these potential sources of anti-competitiveness in the last-mile delivery industry."
Accelerating vehicle fleet turnover to achieve sustainable mobility goals,Sergey Naumov,01 March 2022,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1173,"AbstractAchieving societal climate goals requires rapid reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from transportation. Recent efforts by policymakers have focused on increasing consumer adoption of electric vehicles (EVs). Nevertheless, EV sales remain low. Worse, even if EV market share jumped dramatically, it would take decades to replace the existing vehicle fleet, during which time vehicle GHG emissions would continue, worsening climate change. Consequently, some argue for policies to accelerate the retirement of inefficient fossil-powered vehicles through “cash-for-clunkers” (C4C) programs. We examine C4C policies through a behavioral model of vehicle fleet turnover and EV market development in the United States. We find C4C policies can substantially reduce vehicle fleet emissions at reasonable cost per tonne of CO2. To meet emissions reductions goals, C4C policies should apply only when consumers replace their fossil-powered vehicles with EVs. C4C policies incentivizing EVs accelerate cost reductions through scale economies, charging infrastructure deployment, model variety, and consumer awareness, boosting EV adoption beyond the direct effect of vehicle replacement. The result is a substantial synergy amplifying the impact of C4C and lowering unit cost of emissions reductions. C4C is further amplified when deployed together with complementary policies promoting renewable electricity production and a gas tax or carbon price."
"People, performance and transition: A case study of psychological contract and stakeholder orientation in the Toyota Australia plant closure",Danny Samson,12 September 2022,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1218,"AbstractOperations managers often manage in times of change that exert pressure on values and methods usually developed during more stable eras. With increasing global volatility, companies open and close plants because of demand shifts, cost and reshoring considerations, and government-induced and market forces. Impacts of plant closures on local communities, employees, suppliers, and other stakeholders have been documented, but plant closure processes have not been extensively studied. This paper describes an engaged research study of Toyota Australia's manufacturing closure processes. We apply psychological contract theory, particularly of contract breach, to examine the “respectful” approach Toyota used to close its assembly operation in Melbourne. We examined the role that stakeholder theory plays in describing managerial motivations. Toyota allocated resources beyond typical expectations to prepare its workforce for their post-Toyota careers and lives. During the 4-year transition process, employee performance, and engagement improved, supporting propositions that reserves of employee goodwill can come into play when a psychological contract breach occurs. Further, leadership actions can moderate the negative impacts predicted by that theory, beyond outcomes that more transactional views would predict. Our study offers an elaborated model of psychological contract breach that future researchers can apply to plant closures and related operational contexts."
"Need for speed, but how much does it cost? Unpacking the fee-speed relationship in Bitcoin transactions",Guangzhi Shang,17 July 2022,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1202,"AbstractThe growing popularity of blockchain-based cryptocurrencies is driven by the flexibility in transaction fee offerings, among other factors. To achieve service-level differentiation among their users, many cryptocurrencies allow users to “name your own price,” giving rise to a large variation in fee offerings and hence, variation in confirmation times. Yet, the time it takes a cryptocurrency transaction to be confirmed in the blockchain is not only affected by the fee offered, but also by the contemporaneous congestion level and the inherent randomness in the verification process. Although it is generally expected that higher fees lead to quicker confirmation, the uniqueness of the cryptocurrency setting adds important nuances to the fee-speed relationship. Using Bitcoin—the original and most heavily used cryptocurrency by far—as our empirical context, we stylize the transaction confirmation processes, propose a theoretical framework that maps the causal path from fee to speed, and estimate this framework using Bitcoin transaction data under periods of high volatility. Our results show strong evidence for two characteristics of fee's impact: congestion dependence and tail shrinkage. Our finding that the speed acceleration effect of fee is particularly strong on the tail of the confirmation time distribution motivates a target service level approach to fee recommendation. To put this finding into practice, we develop an efficient computational procedure that helps Bitcoin users accurately estimate fees based on their confirmation delay preferences. We discuss the implications of our analyses on future cryptocurrency development and the long-term adoption of this revolutionary technology."
"Managing a portfolio of environmental projects: Focus, balance, and environmental management capabilities",Xun Tong,06 July 2022,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1201,"AbstractThis research examines the influence of a firm's portfolio of environmental projects on its ability to efficiently improve environmental outcomes. The data comes from Chinese automotive suppliers of a western manufacturer and consists of 154 environmental project portfolios that contain 614 environmental improvement projects as well as firm-level data from Dun & Bradstreet. A data envelopment analysis (DEA) is used to estimate the firms' efficiency in transforming resources into environmental outcomes. Then an econometric analysis evaluates the impact of the portfolio effect (i.e., environmental project portfolio composition) on the firm's efficiency in improving the environment. The empirical results show that when firms reduce the heterogeneity in the types of environmental projects in their portfolios (i.e., a morefocusedportfolio), they can more efficiently improve environmental outcomes. However, firms may want to introduce diversity in the types of environmental projects in their portfolio (i.e., reducing the focus).The analysis shows that more environmentally capable firms can increase the diversity of the projects in their portfolios without negatively impacting outcomes. In addition, firms can better manage diversity in their portfolios when they balance socially oriented projects with technically oriented projects. This study contributes to the theory of project portfolio roles in improving environmental outcomes and offers several novel insights for project portfolio managers working to improve environmental outcomes with limited resources."
Do political ties facilitate operational efficiency? A contingent political embeddedness perspective,Lu Shen,02 August 2022,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1203,"AbstractAlthough the significance of relational ties with supply chain partners to firms' operations management has been frequently studied, it is unclear how political ties, which represent another form of relational ties that is especially important in emerging economies, relate to operational efficiency. Drawing on the political embeddedness perspective, we propose a negative association between political ties and operational efficiency and examine how this association is moderated by environmental and firm-level factors. Using panel data of listed private firms in China, we show that political ties are negatively correlated with operational efficiency. In addition, this negative relationship is stronger when firms operate in regions with less developed factor markets and in highly competitive industries. However, the negative relationship is weaker for firms with high levels of foreign shareholding and customer concentration. These findings caution against the downsides of political ties for operations management and highlight strategies for reducing their negative effect."

Uncertainty in healthcare operations: How hospitals weather the perfect storm,Sriram Thirumalai,01 September 2024,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1327,"AbstractWe focus on two of the many sources of uncertainty in healthcare operations,mix uncertainty– the variation in the complexity of care required by the patient mix, andvolume uncertainty– the variation in the volume of care demanded by the patient population. Using an interdisciplinary perspective, we study the impact ofmix and volume uncertaintieson two important healthcare outcomes,length of stayandnumber of procedures, along with the mitigation impacts of the operational concepts ofrelated focusandutilizationlevels. Based on large dataset of 830,853 patient discharges in 26 clinical departments across 731 hospitals in five U.S. Midwest states, our results indicate thatmix and volume uncertaintieseach have a significant impact on patient care. We also find that related focus and department utilization levels have a mitigating effect on uncertainty in healthcare settings. Lastly, we find considerable heterogeneity in the effects of uncertainty across hospital types and departments. We discuss key research and managerial implications of our findings."
Into the unknown? Explaining management nonresponse after a supply-base disruption,Jiachun Lu,27 December 2023,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1287,"AbstractThe world is witnessing more supply-base disruptions, where multiple suppliers of a buying firm simultaneously experience disturbed operations. Compared to single-supplier disruptions, supply-base disruptions create a more uncertain situation for a purchasing manager, yet they can also reveal improvement opportunities. Hence, it is theoretically and practically valuable to understand why a purchasing manager might not be willing to explore these opportunities. Adopting a sensemaking perspective, we investigate how two dimensions of supply-base disruption severity, breadth and depth, influence managers' perception of disruption severity and post-recovery action (i.e., suggesting supply-base restructuring ideas). We conducted multiple scenario-based experiments with practitioners and triangulated the experimental results with interviews, finding that both breadth and depth have diminishing, positive effects on perceived severity. Interestingly, depth is less influential than breadth. These findings reveal the circumstances under which the severity of a complex, disruptive situation could be misestimated. Our results also show that supply-base structural complexity (a cue of the task environment) amplifies the positive effect of perceived severity on a manager's inclination to walk into the unknown to propose supply-base restructuring ideas. These findings provide an explanation for management nonresponse after a supply-base disruption."
Riding the waves of uncertainty: Towards strategic agility in medicine supply systems,Nonhlanhla Dube,20 September 2024,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1330,"AbstractWe investigate how organizations embedded in a supply system collectively respond to risks and seize opportunities arising from crisis events under shifting forms of uncertainty. Using the United Kingdom (UK) medicine supply system as the research context, we explore how decision-makers navigated the effects of an event with knowable implications (UK's European Union exit, 2016–2020) followed by an event with unknowable implications (COVID-19 global pandemic, 2020–2021). We adopt a longitudinal case research design that incorporates causal loop diagramming, to understand the system's responses. We find that learning evolves as crisis events unfold, changing from surface (know-what) to deep (know-why and -how) and at the highest level, it is transcendent. Transcendent learning entails understanding system effects into the future (i.e., beyond the past and present) and in relation to other supply systems (i.e., beyond the UK system). Capabilities to absorb, avoid, and accelerate away from shocks are developed sequentially as learning changes. We contribute to prior research by developing a theory of system-level strategic agility and the adaptation processes that underpin it. The latter hinge on dynamic resource (re)allocation and the continuous (re)configuration of processes, protocols, regulations, and structures."
Mitigating upstream disruptions: Effects of extended inventories in first- and second-tier suppliers,Christian F. Durach,22 September 2024,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1332,"AbstractThis study examines how inventory slack at first- and second-tier suppliers influences buyer performance following an upstream disruption event. We analyze secondary data from buyer, first-tier, and second-tier triads impacted at their upper end by the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake. By matching buyers in affected triads with similar, largely unaffected firms, we assess post-event performance in relation to triad inventory slack. Results show: (a) inventory slack at the first and second tiers supports buyer performance after the disruption; (b) first-tier inventory slack has a greater impact; (c) buyers with less inventory slack can extract more value from their chains' inventories compared to those with more slack; and (d) first-tier suppliers occupy a pivotal role in bridging the second-tier inventories to the buyer. When competition for the first-tier intensifies, the benefits of having first- and second-tier inventory slack diminish for the buyer. A central contribution of this study is to highlight the importance of resources controlled by chain members with indirect links to the buyer and the bridging role of first-tier suppliers. These insights suggest that for effective risk management, both direct and indirect supply chain resources and their interactions need consideration. Practically, these findings should guide supplier selection, risk management, and investments in supply chain visibility."
Steering through the storm: Environmental uncertainty and delivery performance,Joshua Ignatius,17 September 2024,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1331,"AbstractWe investigate the impact of Typhoon Lekima, a source of environmental uncertainty, on delivery performance, utilizing data from RiRiShun Logistics. We apply a staggered difference-in-differences model across low-complexity and high-complexity supply chains. The analysis uncovers distinct dynamics throughout the typhoon's forecast, active, and recovery phases. Notably, the active phase experiences less disruption in delivery performance compared to the forecast phase, owing to RiRiShun's wait-and-see policy. This approach leads to order accumulation but subsequently enables more effective resource allocation. In the recovery phase, high-complexity supply chains demonstrate significant improvements, surpassing pre-disaster performance levels. The study further emphasizes the critical role of two response mechanisms in managing high-complexity supply chains. Increasing throughput efficiencies at destination centers and implementing transfer centers prove effective in enhancing delivery performance during both the forecast and active phases. However, the simultaneous application of these response mechanisms during the forecast phase unexpectedly reduces performance."

Explicating the microfoundations of operational excellence in services: A capabilities perspective,Vijaya Sunder M,14 July 2024,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1325,"AbstractThe operations management community has recognized operational excellence as a contemporary arena comprising a full spectrum of research paradigms. However, there is a dearth of theoretical development aimed at understanding and unpacking operational excellence and its strategic implications for competitiveness. Much of the existing research focuses on siloed operational improvement practices rather than on inherent capabilities. In this paper, we conceptualize operational excellence from a capabilities perspective. We derive our findings from within- and cross-case analyses based on data gathered from four global banks with varying competitive positions. We posit the microfoundations of operational excellence in services by demonstrating how the cumulative aggregation of constituent capabilities leads to higher competitiveness in firms. We enhance the external validity of the emergent theory by showing its applicability in another service setting (healthcare). Our study demonstrates the importance of shifting managerial thinking from individual operational improvement practices to long-term capability building through the microfoundations of operational excellence."
Collaborative dynamics in open source software development: Unveiling the influence of team interaction and the role of project manager,Sukrit Pal,31 August 2024,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1324,"AbstractAs the world becomes increasingly reliant on open-source software (OSS) development platforms, collaborative communication networks are becoming more complex, resulting in non-trivial effects on project performance. This study examines the impact of communication network characteristics on project performance, measured in terms of the number of issues closed within OSS projects. Additionally, this research examines how this project outcome is affected by project managers' active participation in these communication networks. Using a panel dataset of 1599 projects spanning 104 weeks, with a total of 120,243 observations, we find that the density of communication network has an inverted U-shaped relationship with project performance, that is, as the density of the communication network formed by team member interactions increases, project performance initially increases but then starts to decrease. Meanwhile, a project manager's participation in the communication network has no direct positive impact on project performance, but it flattens the inverted U-shaped relationship, that is, it reduces the rate of decrease in project performance after the density of the communication network formed by project team members crosses the inflection point. These results provide valuable insights into the dynamics of communication networks in OSS projects and can help develop strategies for improving project performance."
Product personalization and brand retailer performance: The critical role of brand retailer-upstream supplier control,Peijian Song,29 August 2024,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1328,"AbstractBrand retailers are increasingly offering product personalization to accommodate the requests of individual customers. While prior research has examined product personalization from a customer's or a manufacturer's perspective, this study focuses on product personalization from a brand retailer's perspective. Under product personalization, brand retailers that outsource production to upstream suppliers face two significant challenges: product returns from downstream customers, and personalization costs charged by upstream suppliers. Employing an analysis of transaction data from an online women's wedding dress firm, this study finds that as product requests increase (i.e., more product features must be modified), personalization costs increase, but the likelihood of product returns decreases. Additionally, as time requests increase (i.e., delivery is more urgent), the likelihood of product returns increases. Furthermore, relationship-specific process control exacerbates (i) the effect of product requests on personalization costs, and (ii) the effect of time requests on the likelihood of product returns. Finally, relationship-specific outcome control and transaction-specific control alleviate the impact of time requests on the likelihood of product returns while exacerbating the effect of product requests on personalization costs. The findings suggest that retailers can realize greater benefits from product personalization by selecting control mechanisms tailored to personalization requests."
Helping hampered bidders—Do subsidy auctions work as intended?,Sanghoon Cho,12 October 2024,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1333,"AbstractThe use of preference or discriminatory auctions, where one class of bidders is offered favored treatment over another class, has received mixed attention in the literature. Research has shown there is often an economic benefit of such policies in procurement auctions thanks to lower costs for buyers as incentives are offered to disadvantaged sellers. In this paper, we study one type of preferential procurement auction: the subsidy. Using a set of controlled experiments, we compare actual bidder behavior to what is predicted in equilibrium and find consistent (but overly aggressive) patterns overall. By testing a common bid strategy assumption, we also identify a behavioral framing bias that may trap sellers in these suboptimal strategies. Finally, we compare subsidies to another common discriminatory mechanism—the price preference—and find evidence that buyers interested in increasing the welfare of disadvantaged sellers should use subsidies instead of price preference auctions, thanks to a surprising difference in outcomes between preference types. Due to the wide use of bid preference auctions to support both policy and social aims, our findings have both financial and societal implications."
When does it pay to be green? The strategic benefits of adoption speed,Hung-Chung Su,29 October 2024,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1337,"AbstractDoes the speed of adopting environmental practices impact financial benefits? The strategy literature discusses the contingencies under which firms can gain an early-mover advantage or a late-mover advantage. This research examines the effect of adoption speed on two types of environmental practices: environmental innovation practices (EIP) and environmental management practices (EMP). The results show that early adoption of EIP increases competitive advantage when firms face intense competition. In comparison, we show that early adoption of EMP increases competitive advantage when firms face extremely low competition or have moderate to high levels of slack resources. The study contributes to the literature by revealing the nuances, contingencies, and boundary conditions of when it pays to be green. Prior research shows mixed results when studying firms' decisions to implement environmental practices, which implies that it may not pay to be green. This study shows that firms can get an early mover advantage from environmental practices, but it depends on the type of environmental practices, the firm's internal slack resources, and the firm's external competitive environment."

Managing coopetition dynamics: A longitudinal study of a multiparty alliance formation in a large utilities project,Renate Taubeneder,29 June 2024,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1320,"AbstractMultiparty alliances (MPAs) are increasingly used to deliver large utilities infrastructure projects on-time, on-budget, and to specified quality. In theory, MPAs should help buyers to coordinate suppliers, enable concurrent scheduling, and create process innovations. On the other hand, these governance structures are inherently less stable than dyadic relationships due to their additional complexity and greater opportunities for free riding. We conduct a multi-source, longitudinal study, investigating how a buyer actively manages the dynamics between competition and cooperation during the formation of an MPA consisting of a lead organization and directional relationships between all partners. We contribute to MPA and coopetition literature by exploring cooperation and competition dynamics that are associated with the MPA structure that would largely be absent in dyads, and unpack the process by which a buyer orchestrates these dynamics by sequentially introducing new initiatives that seek to balance coopetition. MPAs have been recommended by governments and industry bodies as one solution for time and cost overruns in the utilities infrastructure sector, our study also provides guidance to buyers on the management of the alliance during the critical formation stage of the relationship lifecycle."
Public utility obstacles and labor productivity growth: The moderating effect of national culture,Shenyang Jiang,16 August 2024,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1329,"AbstractOperational challenges arising from public utility obstacles are widespread globally, leading to production disruptions, decreased sales, and escalated logistics costs, ultimately contributing to a decline in firm labor productivity growth. Despite the criticality of this issue, there is a scarcity of studies in the field of operations management that investigate factors capable of mitigating these adverse impacts. Taking power outages and transportation obstacles as pivotal examples, our study aims to examine whether national culture can moderate the impact of public utility obstacles on firm labor productivity growth. To achieve this objective, we conduct an empirical analysis using a multi-country dataset from the World Bank Enterprises Survey, which covers detailed firm-level information across 28 industries in 41 countries, with a total of 17,227 firm-year observations. Our findings indicate that the detrimental effects of power outages and transportation obstacles on firm labor productivity growth are contingent on various dimensions of national culture. Specifically, cultural power distance and uncertainty avoidance would amplify the negative impact of power outages, whereas long-term orientation would alleviate this impact. Meanwhile, individualism and masculinity can help mitigate the adverse effects of transportation obstacles. Our results provide valuable insights for managers."
Effects of feedback in manufacturing: A field experiment using smartwatch technology,Daniel Kwasnitschka,20 April 2024,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1305,"AbstractWe investigate the impact of performance feedback delivered to front-line workers through new digital technologies in the manufacturing sector. Our study takes place in a globally operating manufacturing company that employs smartwatches for real-time control on the shop floor. In a large-scale and multi-site field experiment, we examine 29,669 machine status reports to assess the productivity effects of providing near real-time feedback to workers via smartwatches. We develop our hypotheses drawing on construal-level theory and its central idea of psychological distance. Initially, we observe production without feedback to establish comparability between treatment groups. Subsequently, we allocate various combinations of feedback to workers in four separate areas in two manufacturing plants. We manipulate whether the feedback is targeted at individuals with psychologically close feedback (“you did…”) or targeted at the team with relatively psychologically distant feedback (“your team did…”). Furthermore, we vary the message framing: positive framing emphasizes completed tasks, while negative framing emphasizes unfinished tasks. Our findings indicate that positively framed feedback, targeting individuals directly, enhances productivity more than other feedback combinations. Our study contributes new theoretical insights into the interplay between feedback framing and targets in fast-paced and highly automated batch production environments."
The impact of project-based interorganizational networks: Evidence from the Chinese movie industry,Lingjia Li,20 May 2024,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1317,"AbstractProject-based interorganizational networks are temporary and dynamic, and significantly different from stable networks for mass production. However, empirical studies on project-based interorganizational networks are scant. Drawing upon the network literature and distinguishing between production and distribution networks, we investigate how the centrality of a project in industry networks and tie strength of the project's member firms affect project performance in terms of product quality and sales. Using data of 821 Chinese movie projects during 2015–2018, we find empirical evidence that a project's centrality in the production network enhances product quality and that in the distribution network elevates product sales. Interestingly, weak ties in the production team contribute to product quality while strong ties in the distribution team improve product sales. This study advances the literature on project-based industries and interorganizational networks. It highlights the distinction between production and distribution networks in project-based industries and sheds light on the differential roles of a project's centrality and tie strength in both networks. These findings also offer novel insights to managers in project-based industries."
Follow-suit or free-ride? A relational view of CSR diffusion in a supply chain with customer–supplier closure,Ellie C. Falcone,09 June 2024,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1319,"AbstractEmbedded in networks of relationships, firms are who they buy from and sell to. As a result, a firm's corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices can be influenced by CSR practices of its customers and suppliers—known as CSR diffusion. This study examines how CSR diffuses in a supply chain that encompasses a focal firm, its suppliers, and customers. Adopting a relational view, this research hypothesizes that a firm's CSR is influenced by its customer-base CSR differently than its supply-base CSR. By analyzing panel data consisting of 1972 firm-year observations integrated from multiple data sources, the results offer evidence for a positive impact of customer-base CSR and a negative impact of supply-base CSR on firm CSR. Interestingly, when customers and suppliers of a focal firm establish direct business connections (i.e., customer–supplier closure), the positive follow-suit effect of customer-base CSR is enhanced. In contrast, the negative free-ride effect of supply-base CSR is diminished. This suggests that a focal firm is more likely to embrace CSR practices from CSR-active supply chain partners when embedded in closed triads. This research shows the need to consider the directionality and closure of relationships in understanding the diffusion of voluntary, ill-defined, costly operational practices within a supply chain."
Toward health promotion and prevention: Evidence from a food and health partnership model of care,John Lowrey,01 July 2024,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1321,"AbstractHealth promotion and disease prevention requires health systems address the patients' social needs using new care delivery models. Yet, research in this area has stalled for several reasons. We study a partnership model of care that couples clinical care delivered by primary care providers and social services delivered by community-based organizations, and its impact on patients' preventive health outcomes and behaviors. We use data from the Mid-Ohio Farmacy, which is a collaboration across the Mid-Ohio Food Collective (MOFC), a network of 650+ affiliated food pantries, and a large federally qualified health center (FQHC). The FQHC offers primary and preventative healthcare services across eight free clinics, which are co-located with the MOFC-affiliated food pantries. Patients were screened for food insecurity during their clinic visit and, if positive, were referred to the Farmacy. Compliers made at least one visit to the food pantry after referral, while noncompliers did not. Using difference-in-differences, we find that compliers had no discernible change in their body mass index (BMI, kg/m2), which we refer to as a BMI stabilization effect. Noncompliers' BMI increased after referral. High comorbid and high pantry use compliers experienced a significant reduction in their BMI and a marginally significant reduction in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c, %). These patients had unique compliance behaviors, including greater search, frequency, and consistency of food pantry use. Travel costs suggests that high comorbid patients ascribed a greater value to the Farmacy program. In terms of primary care utilization, we find that compliers' clinic visit patterns after referral were consistent with the visit patterns observed in the food secure cohort, suggesting that the Farmacy program may have helped compliers address competing demands that are known to inhibit health behaviors."

Gender mismatch and bias in people-centric operations: Evidence from a randomized field experiment,Yoonseock Son,18 March 2024,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1299,"AbstractResearch at the interface of operations management (OM) and gender bias has mostly focused onoperational outcomessuch as hiring decisions on behalf of theemployer(or firm). Largely overlooked is how thedesign of operational processesexacerbates (or diminishes) the amount of gender bias exhibited on behalf of thecustomerin a people-centric operations environment. In this study, we conduct a randomized field experiment with a partner firm to assess gender mismatch and bias in client-consultant exchanges. The experimental design enables us to examine gender bias within dyadic exchanges when there are gender matches (female client-female consultant or male client-male consultant) or gender mismatches (female client-male consultant or male client-female consultant). We find that reporting the consultant's gender significantly increases the client's likelihood of leaving more and higher reviews, increases the clickthrough rate on recommended products, and that the effect is stronger for females than for male consultants. We also provide support for the heterogenous effects of client experience depending on the gender (mis)match in client-consultant exchanges, including whether the prior effects hold when there is gender masking or manipulation (e.g., reported female consultant when actually male). Our findings offer important theoretical contributions and practical implications for OM scholars and managers."
Emphasizing worker identification with skills to increase helping and productivity in production: A field experiment,Henrik Franke,28 March 2024,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1300,"AbstractCan productivity improve if workers identify more with the skills they use in their work environment? This paper reports the results of an experimental design that was peer-reviewed prior to collecting data. The research setting is a global manufacturer using a novel smartwatch-based system for distributing work tasks among factory floor workers. Drawing on the concepts of identification and helping in organizations, we hypothesized that fostering workers' identification with their own skills could serve as a mechanism to enhance helping behavior on the factory floor, which should improve productivity. We designed a compound skill-fostering treatment consisting of communication, meetings, and exercises regarding individual skills. We treat one large factory area for 2 weeks and keep a similar area in a sister factory as a control group for comparison in a difference-in-difference model. The results show that nudging skill identification increases workers' identification with skills, but we do not find evidence for increased helping behavior or increased productivity. Our results help develop theory around multiple sub-identities and provide guidance for future studies seeking to enhance identification in organizations."
Trade credits and visit frequency: The role of order financing on logistics efficiency in the nanostore setting,Rafael Escamilla,17 July 2024,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1323,"AbstractMillions of mom-and-pop nanostores dominate the grocery retail landscape in emerging markets. As nanostores are cash and storage space constrained, their suppliers tend to visit them with a high frequency, causing high operational costs. It is unclear if credit could mitigate such costs by allowing for a lower visit frequency. To investigate this, we conduct a randomized field experiment on nanostores that have not made recent use of supplier credit, with the objective to uncover how trade credits interact with the visit frequency and with the available storage space to shape shopkeepers' ordering behavior. We find that trade credits moderate the positive relationship between visit frequency and bi-weekly order size, with credit effects being salient under low frequency visits. Storage space, by contrast, does not directionally shape shopkeepers' ordering behavior. While trade credits may more than offset the negative effect of low frequency visits among adopting nanostores, credit adoption remains challenging, with only 24% of nanostores assigned to the credit condition actually adopting the credit. Remarkably, not a single credit line was defaulted over the entire duration of the intervention. In terms of assortment, trade credit is mostly used to acquire nanostores' core assortment of popular, low-price items with low physical volume. We contribute to the extant literature by showing that the gesture by the supplier to extend trade credit may only partly legitimize a reduction of the visit frequency."
Locking in overseas buyers amid geopolitical conflicts,Di Fan,26 May 2024,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1316,"AbstractGeopolitical conflicts, particularly economic ones, introduce significant uncertainties into the global supply chain. The impact of these conflicts on cross-border buyer–supplier transactions remains underexplored, as does the capability of global suppliers to mitigate such risks by locking in their foreign buyers. Employing a combined perspective of resource dependence theory and transaction cost economics, we examine a natural experiment to investigate the effects of the 2018 U.S.–China trade war on the transactional relationships between Chinese suppliers and their U.S. buyers. Our study reveals that the trade war generally adversely affected these buyer–supplier transactional relationships, leading to a negative abnormal transaction value in the affected dyads, which amounted to 18.42% of their pre-event level. However, we find that this adverse impact can be attenuated when Chinese suppliers demonstrate superior innovation capabilities, higher corporate social responsibility performance, or fewer local political ties. These findings yield insights for international suppliers and buyers on strategies to maintain buyer–supplier transactions and minimize the detrimental effects on global supply chain relationships during geopolitical conflicts."
Do mid-level providers enhance hospital cost per discharge or triple aim performance efficiency? An exploratory analysis,Aaron W. Bonnett,26 May 2024,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1307,"AbstractHospital administrators are shifting care delivery models toward an approach that uses more caregivers in the form of mid-level providers (MLPs), such as nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and clinical nurse specialists. To date, however, healthcare operations management (OM) literature remains ambiguous about longitudinal empirical associations between mid-level providers and hospital costs, quality, and other performance measures. We analyze how the extent of MLP employment used by a hospital is associated with hospital operational outcomes, as reflected by hospital cost per discharge and Triple Aim Performance (TAP) efficiency metrics. Our findings indicate percent MLP usage is positively associated with efficiency metrics for hospital clinical quality, technical efficiency, and patient experience, but not associated with hospital costs. We also find percent MLP usage is associated with the likelihood that hospitals excel on all TAP metrics simultaneously. Post-hoc exploratory analyses suggest the associations exhibit differential outcomes across hospital efficiency quantiles, while sub-sample analyses motivate boundary conditions for some hypothesized MLP associations. We contribute to healthcare OM research by providing one of the first panel data analyses of MLPs, improving insights relative to extant work. By giving key stakeholders useful findings about outcomes associated with hospital staffing trends, our managerial contribution helps hospital administrators understand empirical consequences of the increasing use of MLPs."
Causal inference under selection on observables in operations management research: Matching methods and synthetic controls,Övünç Yılmaz,19 June 2024,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1318,"AbstractThe majority of recent empirical papers in operations management (OM) employ observational data to investigate the causal effects of a treatment, such as program or policy adoption. However, as observational data lacks the benefit of random treatment assignment, estimating causal effects poses challenges. In the specific scenario where one can reasonably assume that all confounding factors are observed—referred to asselection on observables—matching methods and synthetic controls can assist researchers to replicate a randomized experiment, the most desirable setting for drawing causal inferences. In this paper, we first present an overview of matching methods and their utilization in the OM literature. Subsequently, we establish the framework and provide pragmatic guidance forpropensity score matchingandcoarsened exact matching, which have garnered considerable attention in recent OM studies. Following this, we conduct a comprehensive simulation study that compares diverse matching algorithms across various scenarios, providing practical insights derived from our findings. Finally, we discusssynthetic controls, a method that offers unique advantages over matching techniques in specific scenarios and is expected to become even more popular in the OM field in the near future. We hope that this paper will serve as a catalyst for promoting a more rigorous application of matching and synthetic control methodologies."
Gender mismatch and bias in people-centric operations: Evidence from a randomized field experiment,Yoonseock Son,27 March 2023,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1249,"AbstractWhile considerable progress has been made in understanding gender mismatch and bias in the physical workplace, there is a limited understanding of how these biases manifest in online platforms where gender masking and manipulation can easily occur. In this study, we collaborate with an online product and service firm in Asia and propose a field experiment design to examine how gender bias influences people-centric operations in online platforms. By assigning different gender combinations of clients and consultants, we examine how the effect of gender bias differs depending on the gender match or mismatch of the entities in the information exchange process. Using 7 months of data, we provide preliminary evidence of gender biases of different client-consultant gender pairings. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed."
Holding North: Recognizing identity and advancing contribution in operations management,Elliot Bendoly,01 May 2024,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1306,
US federal government contracting for disaster management,Carlos Mena,16 January 2024,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1292,"AbstractDisasters affect hundreds of millions of people every year and the response of governments is crucial in alleviating the suffering of those affected. Despite the importance of contracting in response to disasters, research on this topic is conspicuous by its absence. This paper begins to address this gap by investigating the choice of procurement contract type by US federal agencies during disaster management operations. The research relies on 47,560 contracts issued by the US federal government in response to 14 major disasters between 2005 and 2016. We build on agency theory to investigate the choice of the contract type made by federal agencies at the different stages of a relief operation. This research provides empirical evidence of the key factors underpinning the choice of contract in the context of disaster management, namely the amount of spend per contract and the type of acquisition (product or service), and reveals the moderating role of the stage of the relief operation."
Transition paths for condition-based maintenance-driven smart services,Henk Akkermans,22 January 2024,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1295,"AbstractThis research investigates growth inhibitors for smart services driven by condition-based maintenance (CBM). Despite the fast rise of Industry 4.0 technologies, such as smart sensoring, internet of things, and machine learning (ML), smart services have failed to keep pace. Combined, these technologies enable CBM to achieve the lean goal of high reliability and low waste for industrial equipment. Equipment located at customers throughout the world can be monitored and maintained by manufacturers and service providers, but so far industry uptake has been slow. The contributions of this study are twofold. First, it uncovers industry settings that impede the use of equipment failure data needed to train ML algorithms to predict failures and use these predictions to trigger maintenance. These empirical settings, drawn from four global machine equipment manufacturers, include either under- or over-maintenance (i.e., either too much or too little periodic maintenance). Second, formal analysis of a system dynamics model based on these empirical settings reveals a sweet spot of industry settings in which such inhibitors are absent. Companies that fall outside this sweet spot need to follow specific transition paths to reach it. This research discusses these paths, from both a research and practice perspective."
Vendor selection in the wake of data breaches: A longitudinal study,Qian Wang,29 January 2024,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1294,"AbstractWith the increasing digitization and networking of medical data and personal health information, information security has become a critical factor in vendor selection. However, limited understanding exists regarding how information security influences vendor selection. Drawing from the attention-based view (ABV), this study examines the potential impact of data breaches on hospitals' selection of electronic medical record system (EMRS) vendors. To test our hypotheses, we compile a unique dataset spanning 12 years of observations from US hospitals. Utilizing a coarsened exact matching (CEM) technique combined with a difference-in-differences (DiD) approach, our study shows that hospitals tend to replace their EMRS vendors after experiencing data breaches. Moreover, breached hospitals tend to prioritize information security in such a vendor replacement process by switching to star vendors and migrating towards a single-sourcing configuration. Further post-hoc analyses reveal that these impacts of data breaches are mitigated as the relationship between breached hospitals and vendors matures or when hospitals belong to large healthcare systems. Additionally, we find that the effects of data breaches are contingent on the scale of the breach and are short-term in nature. This research underscores the significance of information security as a crucial consideration in vendor selection for both academia and practitioners."
An investigation of corporate social responsibility conformity: The roles of network prominence and supply chain partners,Ellie C. Falcone,27 March 2024,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1302,"AbstractNumerous studies on corporate social responsibility (CSR) indicate that firms adopt CSR practices for various reasons related to their supply chain. However, the necessity to conform to a firm's own industry CSR norm is overlooked. Conforming to one's industry CSR norm—a herding behavior known asCSR conformity—ensures firm in-group legitimacy and preserves internal resources for core business activities. On the other hand, deviating from industry norms sets a firm apart from its peers, making the firm more appealing to supply chain partners. Motivated by this dilemma, this study draws on middle-status conformity theory and explores how a firm's network prominence determines its CSR conformity. Panel data analyses of 1650 firm-year observations reveal an inverse U-shaped relationship between firm network prominence and its CSR conformity, indicating that firms with a mid-level network prominence engage in higher CSR conformity. However, the inverse U is flattened when a firm's supply chain partners (and their respective industries) share similar CSR standards, suggesting that a firm can only prioritize its own industry CSR norms if its supply chain partners share a compatible CSR standard. These findings highlight the importance of understanding CSR from an organizational conformity perspective, especially in the context of supply chain network."
An empirical analysis of process improvement from best practice adoption: A study of stroke care best practices,Brandon Lee,03 April 2024,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1301,"AbstractThis study empirically examines how induced learning through adopting a set of best practices and learning-by-doing improved a hospital's care of ischemic stroke patients using ad hoc teams. While previous studies in healthcare operations management conducted in ad hoc team environments predominantly focused on volume-based learning (learning by doing, team familiarity via interactions among team members), our study focuses on induced learning in ad hoc teams through best practice adoptions. The analysis uses secondary data (Data period: January 2009–March 2017) about stroke patients from a comprehensive stroke center (CSC) in a U.S. tertiary teaching hospital as it adopted the U.S. American Heart Association/American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA)Target:Strokebest practices. The ad hoc stroke teams provide the initial care and their performance is measured using “Door-to-Needle (DTN)” time and its sub-time segments. TheDTNtime is measured as the time elapsed between the stroke patient's arrival at the hospital's emergency department (ED) and the appropriate infusion of “Tissue Plasminogen Activator (TPA)” (i.e., a thrombolytic medication informally referred to as a “clot buster”). We found that adopting these best practices improved ischemic stroke care beyond improvement due to repetition. We also found that the neurologist's recent experience providing stroke care for the prior patient is positively associated with meeting the time performance goal for the current patient. This study provides insights into the use of management mechanisms to adopt and sustain best practices in healthcare that are generalizable to other organizations with ad hoc team environments."
When do part-time workers increase effectiveness? A study of food banks and the SNAP program outreach,Luv Sharma,09 April 2024,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1304,"AbstractThe use of part-time employees to support operations has been a contentious topic in the literature. While part-time employees add cost-effective flexibility to operations, their impact on operational outcomes has largely been documented as negative. However, there are a number of sectors (e.g., non-profit) which rely heavily on part-time employees, with anecdotal evidence supporting their role in improving outcomes. Through this research, we seek to shed light on these contradicting perspectives. We do so by investigating the impact of the percentage of part-time employees in the workforce dedicated to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) outreach efforts at United States (U.S.) food banks on the effectiveness of this initiative. SNAP is the largest domestic hunger program in the U.S., assisting over 42 million individuals, and food banks play a critical role in outreach and enrollment for SNAP. We utilize data on the operational characteristics and SNAP activities of food banks that are members of the Feeding America network and U.S. Census data on the demographic characteristics of their service area. We find that an increased percentage of part-time FTEs (full-time equivalent) in a food bank's workforce dedicated to SNAP outreach efforts increases its effectiveness, particularly in relation to operational and contextual factors that can benefit from a more flexible workforce. Based on these findings and our review of the literature, we propose a conceptual framework on the effectiveness of part-time employees in different settings."
Carbon neutrality: Operations management research opportunities,Qingyu Zhang,26 March 2024,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1303,"AbstractClimate change, primarily driven by greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs), is a pressing environmental and societal concern. Carbon neutrality, or net zero, involves reducing carbon dioxide emissions, the most common GHG, and then balancing residual emissions through removing or offsetting. Particularly difficult challenges have emerged for firms seeking to reduce emissions from Scope 1 (internal operations) and Scope 3 (supply chain). Incremental changes are very unlikely to meet the objective of carbon neutrality. Synthesizing a framework that draws together both the means of achieving carbon neutrality and the scope of change helps to clarify opportunities for research by operations management scholars. Companies must assess and apply promising technologies, form new strategic relationships, and adopt novel practices while taking into account costs, risks, implications for stakeholders, and, most importantly, business sustainability. Research on carbon neutrality is encouraged to move beyond isolated discussions focused on specific tactics and embrace a more, though not fully, holistic examination. Research opportunities abound in both theoretical and empirical domains, such as exploring tradeoffs between different tactics, balancing portfolios, and investigating the strategic deployment of initiatives over time. As a research community, we are critically positioned to develop integrative insights at multiple levels, from individual processes to horizontal and vertical partnerships and ultimately to large-scale systemic realignment and change."
Customer base environmental disclosure and supplier greenhouse gas emissions: A signaling theory perspective,Sining Song,25 July 2023,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1272,"AbstractAs suppliers' emissions contribute to a significant portion of the global environmental footprint, achieving supply chain wide carbon neutrality largely depends on suppliers' greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions. Although suppliers' customers are increasingly signaling their commitment to tackling climate change through environmental disclosure, whether this signal contributes to supplier emissions reduction remains a question. Using signaling theory, this research proposes an emissions-reducing effect of customer base environmental disclosure on a supplier's GHG emissions level. Using a 2010–2017 panel dataset from multiple sources, we find empirical evidence supporting the upstream emissions-reducing effect of customer base environmental disclosure. Further, we identify two customer-base characteristics that affect this relationship: customer base climate innovation and competition. These findings contribute to the sustainable supply chain management literature by illustrating the effects of the customer base on supplier emissions performance. Specifically, customers could motivate a supplier's engagement in emissions reduction by collectively signaling their environmental commitment through enhanced disclosure. However, the effectiveness of this signaling effect can be contingent on the green innovation and competitive dynamics of the customer base."
Benchmark and performance progression: Examining the roles of market competition and focus,Xin (David) Ding,02 January 2024,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1288,"AbstractAs the US healthcare system transitions from volume to value, various value-based programs tie medical reimbursements to hospital performance relative to national top performers (i.e., benchmarks). However, prior studies report very limited results on how such benchmarks affect care delivery and patient outcomes across multiple performance fronts. This study examines how general acute care hospitals progress toward benchmarks measured by performance frontiers in technical efficiency, clinical quality, and patient experience over time, subjecting to external market conditions and internal focuses. Based on a panel dataset comprising hospitals in California from 2012 and 2019, our results find support for competitive-distance-driven progression rates, suggesting that hospitals' competitive positions measured by their distances to benchmarks drive performance improvements. Yet, the effect diminishes as they move closer to performance frontiers. In addition, we find that market competition reduces the progression rate of technical efficiency. Finally, our results also suggest that focus improves performance progression rates, yet its effects are curvilinear."
Fitting digital visualization board transitions to shop floor tasks,John Bang Mathiasen,02 January 2024,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1290,"AbstractThe increased digitalization of shop floors has provided unprecedented opportunities for real-time sharing of process and resource details. Visualization boards (VBs), which provide ubiquitous technology-enabled renderings of such details, salient to a local shop-floor setting, have the potential to play a significant role in this regard. Critical to the effectiveness of this role is the fit between VB design and shop-floor needs. In our study, we apply task-technology-fit theory in case examinations focused on identifying mismatch, implications of mismatch, and putative best practices in designs for future interventions. Our assessment capitalizes on both core operations management design principles as well as technology management design principles. We develop grounded propositions regarding guidelines that should be applied in future VB designs and deployments."
Supply chain representation on the board of directors and firm performance: A balance of relational rents and agency costs,Jordan M. Barker,10 January 2024,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1291,"AbstractAppointing individuals drawn from suppliers and customers to a firm's board of directors is an increasingly popular practice that can enhance the interorganizational relationship and generate relational rents. Yet, such board members may act in the best interest of their primary employer rather than the shareholders of the firm whose board they serve on, thus creating potential agency conflicts. Drawing on the relational view and agency theory, we explore the tension between rent generation and agency costs and consider how a firm can design governance mechanisms to effectively leverage customer or supplier representation on the board of directors. The associated hypotheses are tested using a large panel dataset constructed from multiple archival sources, and our findings suggest that supplier and customer board members are a double-edged sword: While they generate value in some instances, they can also be associated with lower performance depending on the levels of two key governance mechanisms—the number of inside directors on the board and the proportion of outcome-based board member compensation."
Does leader disability status influence the operational performance of teams with individuals with disabilities? An empirical study in the apparel industry,Dustin Cole,08 January 2024,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1289,"AbstractThis research examines the impact of leader disability status on the operational performance of teams that include individuals with disabilities (IWD) using longitudinal micro-data from an apparel manufacturing company in a competitive integrative employment environment. To aid in developing the research hypotheses and in interpreting the empirical findings, the quantitative analysis is complemented with qualitative data collected through interviews involving managers and workers with and without disabilities at the focal firm and two other large companies that employ IWD. A beneficial moderating effect of leader-worker disability status similarity on team performance is hypothesized and subsequently tested using Prais-Winsten regression. The results show that a leader with a disability has a potentially beneficial impact on team performance as the number of workers with disabilities in the team increases, resulting in improved productivity (measured in labor hours per garment) and quality (measured in operator defects per garment). The theoretical, managerial, and policy implications of the study provide actionable insights for the creation of an inclusive labor force."
Using algorithms to improve knowledge work,Javier Amaya,25 February 2024,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1296,"AbstractWe explore how organizations leverage algorithms to improve knowledge work in contexts where the tasks require skilled work, as distinct from routine tasks that have traditionally been the focus of academic enquiry. Drawing on a multiple-case study of four business areas in a multinational energy firm undergoing a digital transformation, we find that contrary to what the literature predicts, tasks that require skilled work can also benefit from the adoption of algorithmic solutions. To benefit, business areas engaged in two distinct pathways for transforming knowledge work. The first focuses on automating a specific task, replacing human activity with algorithms in a single task. The second involves re-engineering an entire process, whereby sequences of steps adjacent to the task at hand are redesigned on integration of an algorithm. We find that these pathways have different effects on the ability to improve knowledge work, suggesting that alignment between the task and the pathway chosen is crucial to realizing any improvement. We also find that the ability to sustain any improvement depends on the adjustment of the knowledge regime—the practices and structures that sanction knowledge. Building on these findings, we propose a general process model for the adoption of algorithmic solutions in knowledge work. In the wider context of the future of work debate, our findings challenge the prevailing notion that a task's skill requirements determine the extent to which knowledge work can be improved by algorithmic solutions."
Closed-loop supply chains with product remanufacturing: Challenges and opportunities,Saurabh Bansal,27 February 2024,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1298,
Closed loop supply chains in apparel: Current state and future directions,Meltem Denizel,24 September 2023,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1274,"AbstractThe apparel and textile industry (AT) is considered one of the most polluting industries in the world due to the complexity of the supply chain and the high volume of natural resources and toxic chemicals used during manufacturing. Closed loop supply chains (CLSC) for apparel and textile are unique and therefore the circular economy solutions that exist for other industries, especially the electronics industry where these solutions are used extensively, may not be successful. This study aims to evaluate the practices of fashion brands that currently employ a CLSC to better understand the existing strategies and prevalent issues in comparison to the electronics industry. We developed a framework based on factors that identify the delineating aspects of a CLSC and performed a content analysis of the publicly available sustainability reports of companies. The results show the need for different solutions between the industries and indicate a need for research that is informed by the AT specific contextual factors since one-fits-all solutions will not work well across industries."
Friend or foe? The impact of refurbished products in markets with network effects and standards competition,Yilong (Eric) Zheng,06 November 2023,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1279,"AbstractThe practice of offering refurbished products has become increasingly prevalent, yet limited research has studied the potential consequences of this emerging product strategy on the market performance of the corresponding brand-new products. This study addresses this gap by examining the impact of refurbished products in markets characterized by network effects and standards competition, while considering the developmental stage of the technology standard employed by the products. Introducing refurbished products, primarily remanufactured from returned items, can pose challenges such as sales cannibalization and negative perceptions of product quality. We propose that introducing refurbished products can also generate positive effects, because the availability of refurbished products can be perceived as an indication of sizable prior sales of the brand-new counterparts, alleviating consumers' concerns regarding an insufficient user base and limited availability of complementary products. Our empirical and experimental studies consistently demonstrate that the availability of refurbished products adversely affects the market value and purchase intention of the corresponding brand-new products employing established technology standards. In contrast, the introduction of refurbished products does not have such a detrimental effect on products utilizing unestablished standards. Moreover, for a specific group of consumers, this green product strategy increases their purchase intention of brand-new products. The managerial implications of the findings are discussed."
"Show, don't tell: Education and physical exposure effects in remanufactured product markets",Huseyn Abdulla,11 April 2023,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1248,"AbstractWe study the effectiveness of two theoretically and practically relevant interventions designed to increase familiarity with and thereby stimulate the appeal of and willingness to pay (WTP) for remanufactured (refurbished) consumer products that are often found repulsive by consumers: (1) educating consumers about the remanufacturing process, (2) providing physical exposure to remanufactured products. We find that education does not cause an increase in the appeal of and WTP for remanufactured consumer products. Providing physical exposure to remanufactured products, relative to text and text-plus picture or video modalities, significantly increases both the appeal and WTP as a result of increasing perceived quality and decreasing disgust. Sellers can benefit from marketing remanufactured consumer products through physical channels (i.e., brick-and-mortar, outlet, showroom stores) as opposed to solely through online channels, which is the common practice among many sellers."
Antecedent configurations toward supply chain resilience: The joint impact of supply chain integration and big data analytics capability,Yisa Jiang,17 December 2023,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1282,"AbstractMany antecedents identified as essential to supply chain resilience (SCR) are often studied independently, without considering their synergistic effects. Based on a case study and resource orchestration theory, this article focuses on configurations of different antecedents regarding supply chain integration and big data analytics capability to develop proactive and reactive SCR. Using survey data from 277 Chinese manufacturing firms, we consider three dimensions of supply chain integration, information integration, operational integration and relational integration, and three dimensions of big data analytics capability, technical skills, managerial skills and data driven-decision culture, and conduct fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to explore antecedent configurations generating high proactive and reactive SCR. We find that multiple antecedent configurations can achieve high SCR and configurations for high proactive and reactive SCR are not identical, which may involve alternative effects across different antecedents. We further implement propensity score matching analysis and reveal that firms following these configurations for high SCR also have better economic and operational performance. Moreover, we check the robustness of findings by using secondary data and attributes analysis with machine learning. This article complements and extends existing SCR literature from the configurational perspective and provides practical insights for managers to build SCR."
How do suppliers respond to institutional complexity? Examining voluntary public environmental disclosure in a global manufacturing supply network,William Diebel,18 January 2024,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1293,"AbstractWhen making decisions about their commitments to environmental practices and performance, suppliers face heterogenous institutional logics and their diverse prescriptions for action. How do suppliers respond to such institutional complexity? We examine this question in the context of suppliers' voluntary public environmental disclosures (disclosure). Specifically, our study assembles a unique panel data set of global manufacturing suppliers and their annual contractual relationships with buyers. Building on the institutional logics perspective and the sustainable supply network literature, we hypothesize that suppliers selectively mimic the disclosure of their buyers by following market, corporate, and sustainability logics. Our study contributes to the institutional logics perspective and the sustainable supply network literature by indicating that in the context of disclosure, market and sustainability logics both actively shape suppliers' responses to institutional complexity. Furthermore, we find support for mimicry as a mechanism of buyer influence that can lead to disclosure heterogeneity across suppliers even when they follow the same logic, which opens new avenues for research. Our findings can be leveraged by buyers, policymakers, and other stakeholders interested in advancing transparency and sustainability in supply networks."
Understanding the impact of trade policy effect uncertainty on firm-level innovation investment,Daniel Chen,04 December 2023,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1285,"AbstractDrawing on real options and resource dependence theories, this study examines how firms adjust their innovation investments to address trade policy effect uncertainty (TPEU), a type of firm-specific, perceived environmental uncertainty capturing managers' difficulty in predicting the impacts of potential policy changes on business operations. To develop a context-dependent, time-varying measure of TPEU, we apply bidirectional encoder representations from transformers, an advanced deep learning technique. We analyze the texts of mandatory management discussion and analysis sections of annual reports from 3181 publicly listed Chinese firms. Our sample comprises 22,669 firm-year observations spanning the years 2007 to 2019. The econometric analyses show that firms experiencing higher TPEU will reduce innovation investments. This effect is stronger for firms facing lower competition, involving more foreign sales, and not owned by the state. These findings provide clarity on previously inconclusive results by showcasing the significant influence of policy effect uncertainty, as opposed to policy state uncertainty, on firms' decisions regarding innovation investments. Additionally, these findings underscore the importance of resource dependence factors as crucial contextual factors in this decision-making process."
Large interorganizational projects (LIPs): Toward an integrative perspective and research agenda on interorganizational governance,Jens K. Roehrich,27 November 2023,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1280,
Platform evolution in large inter-organizational collaborative research programs,Giovanni Radaelli,22 July 2023,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1273,"AbstractWe examine the role of platform sponsors and program managers in evolving a platform to stimulate inter-organizational collaboration in large research programs. Through a 5-year longitudinal case study, we analyzed a large inter-organizational collaborative research program in England, underpinned by the CLAHRC platform, sponsored by the NIHR. The research program attracted clinical academics in universities and clinical practitioners in a range of healthcare providers to collaborate in an ensemble of projects to drive evidence-based care for patients with long-term health conditions. Program managers struggled to facilitate collaboration through the platform, despite a highly decentralized governance approach. Our study identifies three mechanisms through which the platform sponsor and program managers revised the platform's governance strategies to enhance collaboration: (i) they instituted “interruptive events,” which routinely stopped projects, and analyzed if and why organizations struggle to collaborate; (ii) they expanded, rather than restricted, access rules for collaboration through “platform renting”; (iii) they re-distributed, rather than re-centralized, governance, to reduce unnecessary interdependences across collaborators attracted by the platform."
Co-evolution of governance mechanisms and coopetition in public-private projects,Audrey Rouyre,04 December 2023,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1281,"AbstractOne important question in public-private (PP) projects is how to manage coopetition—simultaneous cooperation and competition among project members. Prior studies on the governance of PP projects showed the importance of governance mechanisms to deal with major events such as technical or organizational disruptions but paid limited attention to the management of coopetition. At the same time, research on the management of coopetition mostly focused on industrial coopetition, whereas PP projects also entail public-private coopetition. Seeking to better understand how governance mechanisms may help manage coopetition in PP projects, we conducted an in-depth study of Galileo—a large PP project aimed at delivering Europe's own satellite-based navigation system. The findings show how three core aspects of project governance—(i) mechanisms (joint vs. separate use of contractual and relational mechanisms), (ii) form (lead organization vs. shared governance), and (iii) goals (to promote cooperation and/or prevent competition)—jointly explained the emergence and (mis)management of knowledge- and value-related coopetitive tensions. In turn, these tensions prompted a series of adaptations in the governance of the project. Our study contributes to a co-evolutionary understanding of the governance of PP projects and offers implications for practitioners seeking to (re)design PP project governance."
Down the drain: The dynamic interplay of governance adjustments addressing setbacks in large public–private projects,F. Fang,30 August 2023,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1277,"AbstractLarge government projects involving public–private collaborations inherently suffer from setbacks such as delays, cost overruns, or failure to meet contracted performance. Such setbacks may effectively be addressed through adjustments to contractual and relational governance; yet to date, the dynamics of governance adjustments and their interplay in addressing setbacks is not well understood. This research presents a dynamic theory of how parties can effectively address project setbacks through adjustments to contractual and relational governance. The dynamic theory was generated using longitudinal case data from two large public–private projects in the Netherlands that faced comparable project setbacks but deployed opposing governance adjustments, leading to drastically different project outcomes (i.e., collapse vs. recovery). This theory was then elaborated through two more cases and evidence from the literature. A system dynamics simulation model was then built that reproduces the different governance adjustments and outcomes observed in the four projects and serves to extend theory building. The refined theory not only shows under what conditions adjustments to contractual or relational governance are most effective, but also that governance adjustment interplay may trigger unintended side effects. As such, the theory explains why the careful balancing of governance adjustments is critical to project outcomes."
"Designing the transition to operations in large inter-organizational projects: Strategy, structure, process, and people",Xinyue Zhang,03 September 2023,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1275,"AbstractThe transition from projects to operations requires a spanning from more temporary, goal-oriented, and evolving organizational forms to more permanent, routine, and ongoing organizational forms. A question of practical and theoretical significance is how to organize the transition to operations in large inter-organizational projects. To answer this question, we conducted a longitudinal case study of Beijing Daxing International Airport, which is the largest transportation hub in China to date, and provides rich evidence for successfully managing the transition to operations. By analyzing the organizational design strategy, structures, processes, and management of people in the transition, we provide a synthetic framework for designing the transition to operations in large inter-organizational projects. The framework provides a set of considerations to design organizational boundaries that build connections, emphasize coordination, and achieve continuity between projects and operations. This study contributes to the nexus of operations management and project management and the organizational design of large inter-organizational projects."
"Behavioral multi-lever decision-making: A study of consumer return policy, price, and inventory decisions",Han Kyul Oh,05 September 2023,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1276,"AbstractConsumer return policies have been long recognized and studied by operations management scholars as an important managerial lever in a retail environment. Yet, the behavioral aspects of return policy decision-making and interaction of return policy decisions with other common operational decisions have not been investigated to date. We present a behavioral analysis of return policy decision-making in a retail environment with aggregate demand and individual product valuation uncertainties. Leveraging a generalized newsvendor context, we conduct a randomized behavioral experiment to understand how individuals make each of the three key retail decisions—refund amount, price, and order quantity—and the causal effect of salvage value on these decisions. We find that decision-makers exhibit behavioral regularities in making decisions across the three levers and they react to changes in the operating conditions in a boundedly rational manner, suggesting the use of heuristics. Based on behavioral regularities that we observe in our data—that is, responses, time-dependent effects, and decision dependencies—we develop a process theory based on behavioral decision-making tenets that offers a new direction with testable hypotheses for future research. The process theory describes a conditional decision-making heuristic that leads to a propagation of decision errors across different levers as well as lever-specific decision biases."
Mitigating the curse of complexity: The role of focus and the implications for costs of care,Sriram Thirumalai,23 October 2023,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1278,"AbstractThere has been a resurgence of interest in the role of operational focus in the healthcare operations literature in the backdrop of increasing demand for efficient and effective care. However, the evidence on the benefits of focus in healthcare is mixed. Our study proposes that a key piece of this puzzle that is been largely missing is an explicit consideration of the complexity of patient care needs. Specifically, our study serves to answer the questions: How does the complexity of care requirements affect care delivery operations? How does focus across the hierarchical levels of care affect care delivery outcomes across complexity regimes? The empirical analysis in the study is based on a large generalizable dataset of 246,663 patient discharges across 26 categories at 154 hospitals. We develop a multi-factor measure of complexity of care requirements. The study results point to the deleterious impact of complexity on the costs of care. Next, our findings highlight the differential impact of focus across hierarchical levels (task-level focus, category-level focus, and selective focus in related areas) on the costs of care. Third, our study findings highlight the role of focus in mitigating the effects of complexity on costs in a healthcare setting. We discuss the implications of the study findings for theory and practice, and the directions for future research."
Charting the Future of Blockchain in Operations and Supply Chain Management: Opportunities and Challenges,Fabrice Lumineau,06 August 2025,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.70014,
"Success and Failure of Blockchain Technology Providers: Founders' Power, Beyond-Blockchain Exploration and Centralized Decision-Making",Yuanzhu Zhan,25 March 2025,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1364,"ABSTRACTDespite a growing focus on blockchain adoption within operations and supply chains, these initiatives exhibit an exceedingly high failure rate, with many failing to achieve sustainable success. Why are enterprise blockchain adoptions highly susceptible to failure? In our inductive case study of five technology providers offering blockchain services for operations and supply chains, we examine how founders' power (i.e., expert, prestige, and ownership) shapes management behaviors that build blockchain perceptions and influence stakeholders toward strategic adoption. Our findings reveal that high-performing cases actively seek inspiration beyond the blockchain ecosystem for service designs and adopt a centralized decision-making approach where key strategic decisions are made internally. In contrast, low-performing cases struggle due to within-blockchain exploration and decentralized decision-making, leading to slower implementation and limited scalability. Furthermore, we find that founders' behaviors in blockchain adoption are embraced by firm members through performance evaluation and interactions, shaping organizational practices and culture, ultimately determining the success or failure of blockchain technology providers. This study extends previous research at the intersection of founders' power and blockchain literature by developing propositions about how different sources of founders' power lead to distinct management behaviors, influencing the success or failure of blockchain adoption outcomes."
Governing Within Semirigid Limits: Navigating the Centralization–Decentralization Paradox in Blockchain-Based Platforms,Marvin Hanisch,18 June 2025,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.70001,"ABSTRACTBlockchain-based platforms can facilitate data sharing and coordination in interorganizational ecosystems by enabling secure, tamper-evident recordkeeping and streamlined, trust-minimized transactions across organizational boundaries. However, their decentralized architecture may conflict with the centralized control exercised by platform sponsors, giving rise to a centralization–decentralization paradox. This study explores how this paradox unfolds in a large, blockchain-based logistics platform that was ultimately discontinued. Through an in-depth, longitudinal case study, we identify three interrelated governance contradictions—regarding ownership, trust, and growth—that triggered destabilizing oscillations between centralized and decentralized governance modes. We introduce the concept ofsemirigid limitsto capture the bounded flexibility within which governance can be made and adapted under such paradoxical conditions. Our findings show that the centralization–decentralization paradox is especially difficult to navigate when strategic boundary conditions—here, industry competition, fragmented coordination, and high interdependencies—are present. Our study contributes to the paradox and governance literature by theorizing how governance contradictions emerge and persist and by identifying the mechanisms that constrain alignment and adaptation. We also offer guidance for managers in regard to addressing the competing demands of centralization and decentralization in interorganizational platforms."
The Impact of Blockchain-Enabled Smart Contracts on Firms' Operational Efficiency,Yangchun Xiong,13 July 2025,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.70006,"ABSTRACTSmart contracts, enabled by blockchain technology, are increasingly adopted by firms to automate the execution of agreements or contracts without the involvement of intermediaries. However, it is still unclear how smart contracts may affect firms' operational efficiency. We address this issue empirically by conducting a quasi-natural experiment in the United States in which certain states have enacted relevant laws that increase in-state firms' propensity to adopt and use smart contracts. Our difference-in-differences estimation suggests that compared with out-of-state control firms, in-state treatment firms' operational efficiency increases significantly after the enactment of smart contract laws. Our post hoc analysis further suggests that state-level smart contract laws help increase in-state firms' actual smart contract activities, which in turn lead to operational efficiency improvement. We also find that the operational efficiency improvement varies across firms with different supply chain complexities. While firms with a large number of supply chain partners (i.e., high horizontal complexity) gain more operational efficiency improvement, the improvement becomes less pronounced if firms' supply chain partners are distributed across different countries (i.e., high spatial complexity). Overall, our research not only demonstrates smart contracts' ability to improve operational efficiency but also reveals the critical role of supply chain complexity in affecting the operational efficiency improvement."
Incentivizing Blockchain Participation Through Task Assignment Mechanisms: Evidence From a Natural Experiment of Consensus Protocols on Ethereum,Wei Yang,17 March 2025,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1358,"ABSTRACTThis study examines how task assignment mechanisms affect the participation of workers on decentralized blockchains. In developing the theory, I highlight that blockchain represents a distinct organizational form for coordinating operations under a highly decentralized structure, in which the essential tasks of system infrastructure maintenance are assigned to third-party crowd workers through the unique governance mechanism of consensus protocol. I specifically focus on two widely adopted consensus protocols in the context of cryptocurrency, namely, proof-of-work (PoW), which assigns tasks that sustain the blockchain system operation based on workers' investments in computing power, and proof-of-stake (PoS), which assigns these tasks based on workers' investments in the native cryptocurrency as stakes. I argue that compared with PoW, PoS increases worker participation and task decentralization because the investment requirement of task participation in the form of blockchain native assets reduces workers' transaction costs in task contracting and their tendencies for hyper-competition. My empirical analysis leverages a natural experiment on Ethereum, namely, the “Merge” event on September 15, 2022, in which the blockchain changed the assignment rules by switching the consensus protocol from PoW to PoS. The results under a difference-in-differences research design confirm my arguments."
"Beyond Money: Incentive Effects of Tokenized Ownership on User Contribution in DAOs
",Kun Chen,23 February 2025,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1351,"ABSTRACTBlockchain technologies have catalyzed the rise of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), which operate in an incentive network fueled by crypto tokens. In essence, these tokens are imbued with either payment rights (i.e., transactional tokens) or ownership rights (i.e., governance tokens). The decentralized organizational paradigm dismantles the traditional management structure and bring new research opportunities to Operations Management (OM). While the performance of DAOs has been largely examined in current OM literature, the effectiveness of their internal incentive mechanisms—specifically the one that uses ownership as rewards to promote user contributions—remains unclear. Focusing on DAO-enabled virtual communities, we seek to examine whether decentralized ownership provides stronger incentives for user behaviors, such as creation and curation, in comparison to traditional monetary rewards through the lens of psychological ownership theory. We obtained data fromSteemitthat captures the reward, creation, curation and transaction behaviors of 98,000 users from May 2017 to April 2019. By leveraging the “power-up” action as a shock that increases user ownership shares, we established a quasi-experimental setting. Employing the PSM-DID model, we found that the use of governance tokens is associated with enhanced creation and curation efforts but declined creation novelty, compared to the use of transactional tokens. Our additional analyses further reveal that the incentive effects of governance tokens diminish over time. However, upon the recurrence of the intended choice, these effects become reinforced. Notably, we find that governance token ownership is more strongly associated with curation efforts for users with weaker social ties. Conversely, for users with high reputation scores, their content creation behaviors are less strongly associated with governance token ownership. This study contributes to the burgeoning discourse on blockchain and cryptocurrency from an operational perspective, providing valuable insights for the design of incentive mechanisms in DAOs and advancing our understanding of operational efficiencies and stakeholder engagement in decentralized structures within Operations Management."
The Impact of “Lazy Minting” on Seller Performance in NFT Marketplaces—A Transaction Cost Economics Perspective,Mengyuan Fang,20 April 2025,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1368,"ABSTRACTIn the burgeoning marketplaces of digital assets, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) revolutionize digital asset ownership and intellectual property (IP) protection, but high minting costs create barriers to marketplace entry and growth. This study examines the impact of “lazy minting,” a new NFT production method introduced by major NFT marketplaces to lower minting costs by deferring blockchain certification until the first sale. In response to the call for further research on emerging technologies in operations management, we explore how this policy affects the net sales performance of existing sellers in the NFT marketplaces. Based on transaction cost economics (TCE) and the literature about different IP protection methods, we distinguish between lazy- and regular-minted NFTs by their differential transaction costs and utilize the staggered difference-in-differences (DID) method to conduct our analysis. We find that lazy minting adoption significantly boosts the net sales performance of existing sellers. This is attributed to their cost-adaptive IP protection behavior. Specifically, they achieve this by minting more NFTs with a larger proportion of style-consistent NFTs through lazy minting, while strategically employing regular minting for style-breaking NFTs, which is contingent upon their reputation. Our study has important theoretical and practical implications for operations management under the emerging technological revolution."
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger? Evidence from vampire attacks on decentralized exchange and non-fungible token marketplace,Xi Zhao,25 December 2024,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1343,"AbstractWe examine the impact of vampire attack, a unique platform entry strategy in the blockchain ecosystem, on the operational performance of the incumbent platform. During the vampire attack period, the entrant (attacker) clones the incumbent platform and offers tokenized incentives to entice users away from the incumbent. Prior studies offer little insight into the impact of vampire attack strategy because of its uniqueness in platform cloning, tokenized incentives, and targeted attacks. We implement a quasi-experimental design by leveraging the first and most famous vampire attack launched by SushiSwap (the attacker) against Uniswap (the incumbent). We examine both the deposit-side and exchange-side impacts of the vampire attack on the operational performance of the liquidity pools on Uniswap. Surprisingly, we find that the vampire attack has no significant effect on the liquidity provision on the deposit side. Even more surprisingly, the vampire attack significantly increases the incumbent's trading volume on the exchange side. We further uncover the underlying mechanisms contributing to these intriguing results. We also demonstrate the efficacy of the novel tokenized incentives strategy. We show the generalizability of our findings by examining an alternative vampire attack event in the context of non-fungible token marketplaces. Our study offers significant contributions to the literature on the implications of blockchain on platform operations and platform competition in operations management."
How to Mitigate Misinformation Diffusion on Blockchain-Based Decentralized Social Network Platforms? Insights From an Agent-Based Simulation Model,Onkar S. Malgonde,21 July 2025,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.70007,"ABSTRACTAlthough the spread of misinformation on centralized social media platforms has received significant attention, few studies compare centralized and decentralized platforms, and how to mitigate misinformation diffusion in newly emerging blockchain-based decentralized social network platforms. We study misinformation diffusion between the decentralized and the centralized platforms and identify three decentralized governance mechanisms to mitigate the spread of misinformation in decentralized networks: user flagging, user article ratings, and user reputation. Our empirical experiments using agent-based simulations leveraging real-world data from two platforms reveal two findings. First, comparing misinformation diffusion between the decentralized Steemit and the centralized Pokec platforms suggests that in the absence of any mitigation mechanisms, misinformation in decentralized platforms affects more users, at faster rates, and reaches shorter distance from the misinformation initiating user. Second, within the decentralized platforms, misinformation affects fewer users, at slower rates, and reaches shorter distance from the misinformation initiating user in the presence of mitigating mechanisms than in their absence. We discuss the implications of these results both for the understanding of misinformation diffusion and for the governance of decentralized social network platforms."
Leveraging Strategic Demand Variability: The Role of Lead-Time Measurement,Rajan Suri,02 July 2025,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.70005,
From the Boardroom to the Jobsite: Female Board Representation and Workplace Safety,Yoonseock Son,29 April 2025,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1370,"ABSTRACTContributing to emerging research on corporate governance and operations management, our study examines the connection between board diversity and workplace safety. We propose that boards with a higher representation of female directors prioritize and thus enhance workplace safety due to women's distinct social-cognitive perspectives on stakeholders, risk avoidance, and regulatory compliance. We also consider two conditions that may strengthen the relationship between female board representation and workplace safety: (1) the power of the female directors on the board, which may cause them to speak out more, and cause others to heed their perspectives; (2) accountability pressures faced by the board, which may increase board member epistemological motivation (the willingness to invest effort to fully understand the board's tasks and decisions being made). Analyzing a unique dataset that covers 1442 firm-year observations across 266 firms, we show that female board representation improves workplace safety when women have more power and when boards face greater accountability pressures. In an empirical extension, we examine how the representation of racial/ethnic minority directors impacts workplace safety and the synergistic effect of female and minority board representation. Our findings deepen our understanding of how board diversity interacts with situational factors to influence operational outcomes."
Strange Dance Partners: Supply Chain Cyberattacks and Chained Vulnerability,Seongkyoon Jeong,06 May 2025,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1374,"ABSTRACTThe concept of “chained vulnerability” addresses the cyberattack risks for organizations through interconnected internal and external actors (e.g., employees and suppliers). As organizational defenses and tactics of antagonistic actors (e.g., hackers) adapt to emerging conditions, certain actors of organizations become compromised as entry points into the targeted organizations. A disruption (i.e., COVID-19) induces operational changes (i.e., digital transformation), and we study the co-evolution of attacks and defenses as if the antagonistic actors, organizations, and their internal and external actors are engaged in a dance together. Building on routine activity theory, our study theorizes the adaptive target suitability where the properties of actors, the types of actors involved, and the consequential phases co-evolve following the disruption. We leverage the COVID-19 pandemic as the empirical context and use a novel dataset of 3497 publicly reported cyber breaches. Analyses reveal that cyberattacks initially focused on internal actors (i.e., deception-based attacks on employees) and then shifted to external actors (i.e., system vulnerability-based attacks on digital infrastructure providers and product suppliers). Semi-structured interviews with experts (e.g., hackers and cybersecurity managers) and subsequent econometric analyses elucidate how strategic interactions between dance partners lead to disruptions that dynamically reshape the landscape of chained vulnerability."
"Analytics Capability, Supply Chain Capabilities, and Operational Performance: A Meta-Analytic Investigation",Alok Raj,26 May 2025,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1376,"ABSTRACTHow does the development of Analytics Capability (AC) of a firm influence its supply chain performance? With increasing numbers of firms adopting data analytics to enhance their supply chains and overall performance, this question has become particularly important. To answer the question, this study proposes and tests three dominant supply chain capabilities (integration, flexibility, and resilience) as key mechanisms through which AC is linked with operational performance. We use 405 effect sizes reported in 174 prior empirical studies based on data gathered from 104,296 informants to draw insights using a meta-analytic structural equation modeling approach. The theory developed herein contributes to the literature by demonstrating thatintegration, flexibility,andresiliencemediate the association between AC and operational performance, which in turn affects customer service performance. Specifically, a substantial degree of variance in the effects of AC on operational performance is mediated by integration, flexibility, and resilience, respectively. We also find that the effect size for the association between AC and operational performance is higher in developing economies, while the link between operational performance and customer service performance is higher in developed economies. Our analyses are robust to several empirical challenges, including (a) common method bias, (b) outliers, (c) endogeneity, and (d) journal quality, attesting to the stability of the findings. Overall, our results suggest that supply chain integration, flexibility, and resilience are key domains of managerial and theoretical focus for implementing firms' data analytics initiatives, reinforcing the role of the supply chain in leveraging data analytics capabilities."
"Prescribers Under Pressure? An Examination of Healthcare Policy, Prescribing Workload, and Competition on Opioid Prescribing",Justin T. Kistler,12 June 2025,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.70003,"ABSTRACTDespite the daunting societal and financial impacts of the opioid crisis, extant research offers only a partial understanding of it, particularly regarding the role of healthcare policy. Accordingly, grounded in institutional theory, we examined how a policy that monitors and financially incentivizes patient satisfaction with pain management during a hospital stay affected opioid prescribing behavior of frontline workers (i.e., prescribers). Leveraging 43 months of opioid prescribing data, our research reveals that the introduction of such a policy is associated with higher opioid prescribing intensity. Furthermore, our results reveal that the policy's unintended consequences were intensified under high levels of prescribing workload and market competition. These findings augment the understanding of the negative impacts of the former and unveil an unfavorable corollary to the positive impacts of the latter. We complemented these results with a qualitative study that revealed the presence of coercive, mimetic, and normative pressures and the influence of prescribing workload and market competition in the prescribing context, instilling confidence in our theorizing, results, and contributions. Our study culminates in prescriptive implications for policymakers, prescribers, and healthcare leaders."
Partner Similarity and Crossover Product Development: Evidence From the PC Game Market,Seongkyoon Jeong,08 June 2025,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.70002,"ABSTRACTThis study addresses a critical gap in understanding the development of crossover products, particularly in the context of collaborative product development within the PC game market's supply chain. Traditionally, firms have focused on incorporating common product characteristics from a single market segment (e.g., genre) to minimize potential penalties associated with ambiguous product identities. However, recent trends show that “crossover” products, those that integrate distinctive features from multiple segments, have emerged due to their superior performance. Developing such innovative products requires profound expertise across multiple market segments, especially when supply chain partners collaborate. While prior research has explored the market performance of crossover products, it has offered limited understanding of the conditions required for their development. To address this gap, we propose a theoretical framework grounded in the input–output perspective of operations management, which examines how portfolio similarity between partners influences the ease of expertise reconfiguration and the breadth of segment-spanning expertise needed for crossover product development. Our findings reveal an inverted U-shaped relationship between portfolio similarity and the degree of crossover, suggesting that moderate similarity fosters the most effective reconfiguration of expertise. Further, we find that collaboration experience with the partner moderates the inverted U-shaped relationship."
Taking Turns Leading? Rotational Leadership in New Product Development Projects With Supplier Involvement,Tingting Yan,15 June 2025,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.70000,"ABSTRACTDespite the potential value of involving suppliers in buyers' new product development (NPD) projects, there are challenges in integrating distributed resources and actions across organizational boundaries. Insight from theintra-organizational leadership literature suggests that an effectiveinter-organizational leadership model could help address project-level coordination challenges. Adopting an agency theory view complemented by role theory, this study examines the antecedents and outcomes of rotational leadership (i.e., shifting leadership roles in a process) in a buyer NPD project involving suppliers. The results indicate a U-shaped relationship between rotational leadership and project performance by analyzing a paired sample of quantitative and qualitative data for 279 NPD projects. In a post hoc qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), this study triangulates quantitative results using interview data, showing that buyers adopt boundary buffering to address potential rotational leadership risks while achieving high project performance. Both buyer risk-taking and supplier relationship-specific investments contribute to the emergence of rotational leadership. These results enrich supplier involvement in the NPD literature by demonstrating (1) when rotational leadership emerges and (2) how it affects project performance. The findings also provide managerial implications for leadership role arrangements and boundary-buffering decisions in the context of collaborative innovation in the supply chain."
Generative AI and Empirical Research Methods in Operations Management,Timofey Shalpegin,05 May 2025,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1371,
Estimation Using Marginal Competitor Sales Information,Kalyan Talluri,19 March 2025,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1359,"ABSTRACTAn abiding preoccupation for firms is understanding how customers value their products versus competitors' products. This is difficult to quantify and estimate from data as, even if competitor prices are public information, their sales are typically unobservable. However, in some industries, most prominently the hotel industry, third-party information brokers collect and supply aggregate competitor sales information. In the hotel industry, these reports from Smith Travel Research, popularly known as STR reports, are widely subscribed to. Hotels participate by reporting their sales information and, in turn, obtain access to marginal competitor sales data, in the form of daily occupancy percentage, albeit aggregated across groups and lengths-of-stay. Despite its availability, this data is not widely incorporated into revenue management estimation, likely due to the lack of robust models and methodologies. In this paper, focusing mainly on the hotel industry, we develop a constrained maximum likelihood method (constrained by moment conditions) to overcome the following significant challenges in estimation of a market share model with a competitor attractiveness factor: (i) competitor data is aggregated across multiple lengths-of-stay with varying demand characteristics; (ii) no-purchase data is unobservable, preventing tracking of customers who choose neither the focal firm's (we refer to as our) product nor the competitor's product; (iii) private (unobserved) group sales of competitors prior to retail sales reduce competitor capacity and influence their subsequent prices; and finally, (iv) maximizing the partial-information likelihood function is intractable. We first evaluate our method through Monte Carlo simulations on synthetic data generated under a generalized Nash competition model. In these simulations, our method accurately recovers the true parameters to a close degree in almost all cases, exploiting the marginal competitor data. Next, we apply the method to real-world hotel booking data and benchmark its performance against alternative approaches from the network tomography and revenue management literature."
How Group Consumption Affects Coupon Acquisition and Redemption: The Moderating Role of Offline Agglomeration in Online Group Buying,Xiayu Chen,19 March 2025,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1357,"ABSTRACTLocal merchants have implemented coupon promotions to attract consumer traffic and improve product sales. Drawing upon signaling theory, this paper examines how a social characteristic of a coupon (i.e., group consumption) influences coupon acquisition and subsequent coupon redemption, along with how such relationships are further influenced by offline agglomeration (i.e., density and product agglomeration). Specifically, we argue that group consumption increases coupon acquisition, which in turn increases coupon redemption, with coupon acquisition serving as a mediator in the relationship. These relationships, however, are contingent upon offline agglomeration signals. Using a large panel data set from a prominent group buying platform, we collect 121,909 observations to test our theoretical model. The findings reveal a positive relationship between group consumption and coupon acquisition and a positive relationship between coupon acquisition and redemption, while the relationship between group consumption and coupon redemption is fully mediated by coupon acquisition. Furthermore, we find that the effect of group consumption on coupon acquisition is strengthened by density agglomeration but attenuated by product agglomeration. The effect of coupon acquisition on redemption is reinforced by density agglomeration. These findings offer valuable implications for local merchants who are seeking to optimize their coupon promotions."
Abundance Versus Scarcity: An Experimental Study of Financially Constrained Newsvendors,Mohd Mujahid Khan,13 March 2025,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1361,"ABSTRACTThis study experimentally investigates the ordering behavior of a financially constrained newsvendor-like retailer facing stochastic demand under trade credit. Using controlled laboratory experiments, we examine the ordering behavior of a retailer procuring inventory on trade credit from the supplier under no-bankruptcy risk (NBR) and bankruptcy risk (BR) at low- and high-profit margins. Our experimental observations show deviations from normative optimality, and we find a contrast in the ordering behavior in NBR and BR settings. Compared to the respective normative optimal quantities, in the NBR setting, retailers overorder in the low-profit margin and underorder in the high-profit margin conditions, whereas, in the BR setting, consistent underordering is observed in both the low and high-profit margin conditions. Next, we employ a dynamic panel regression model driven by the demand-chasing heuristic to capture the ordering pattern. Finally, we develop a prospect theoretic model to describe the underordering behavior observed in the BR setting and find that the reference point plays a key role. Our results provide insights into the need to identify the behavior of financially constrained retailers and develop descriptive models for improved decision making."
Evolutions of Omni-Channel Fulfillment Performance: An In-Depth Case Study in Grocery Retailing,Stuart Milligan,21 March 2025,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1362,"ABSTRACTThe rapid adoption of omni-channel strategies has prompted grocery retailers to reconfigure their back-end fulfillment operations to efficiently and effectively meet the demands of online and offline retail channels. Viewing back-end fulfillment operations in omni-channel grocery retail as a complex adaptive system, we present an eight-year multi-method case study of the UK operations of a leading global grocery retailer. Over this period the share of online sales significantly grew as proportion of overall sales. We observe four evolutions in the back-end fulfillment complex adaptive system to respond to the operational demands associated with increasing online sales. Complex adaptive systems theory suggests that such evolutions should eventually lead to a state of equilibrium, where the system is reconfigured to effectively and efficiently respond to the market. However, we observe that this equilibrium was never achieved and propose this results from two opposing and irreconcilable environmental energies preventing optimal adaptation. Drawing on both in-depth interviews and a proprietary fulfillment dataset from the organization, we expose the implications of conflicting energies being imported from the environment, and propose three strategies, drawn from paradox theory, for reconciling these energies within a complex adaptive system."
Deadline Effect in Stroke Patient Care: A Temporal Motivation Theory Perspective of Process Management,Brandon Lee,07 April 2025,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1360,"ABSTRACTStroke is a highly time-sensitive medical emergency, and earlier treatment is crucial. Drawing on Temporal Motivation Theory, we investigate a “deadline effect” in stroke care and analyze how two deadlines, that is, amedically orientedone (administering Tissue Plasminogen Activator, TPA, within 4.5 h of symptom onset) and agoal-orientedone (the 60-min in-hospital target fromTarget:Stroke), shape care consistency. We define a deadline effect as a variable task processing rate under time pressure from a pending task completion deadline, which can cause inconsistent care. Clinicians may work more slowly when patients arrive soon after symptom onset, given ample time remains before the 4.5-h TPA window. Using an accelerated-failure-time model and addressing patient selection bias, we find that shorter onset-to-door times correlate with longer door-to-needle times, and vice versa, confirming the medically oriented deadline effect. As a result, care time may vary considerably based on how much of the TPA window remains. UnderTarget:Stroke, a goal-driven national initiative in the United States to improve stroke care quality, stroke teams face an additional 60-min in-hospital deadline. Our findings show that the initiative prompts stroke teams to prioritize the tighter goal and maintain a more consistent care pace, regardless of patients' arrival times. Our mechanism analyses reveal two boundary conditions for the main findings: (i) when the downstream time segment ends with a mid-point patient care milestone rather than the strict TPA administration deadline or (ii) when the system congestion level is high, the main findings do not hold, advancing the deadline effect literature from an operational standpoint. Furthermore, our major findings are robust to other confounding factors and model assumptions, ruling out alternative explanations. Notably, post hoc analyses confirm thatTarget:Strokefosters consistent time performance without adversely affecting other health outcomes, advocating its efficacy. In sum, we highlight the operational implications of multiple deadlines in stroke care, extending the broader deadline effect literature. For hospital clinicians, properly set goals can stabilize care processes and strengthen overall performance, emphasizing the strategic value of well-designed deadlines in time-critical healthcare settings."
Nudging Tactics for Enhanced Compliance With Condition-Based Maintenance Guidelines,Mateus do Rego Ferreira Lima,10 April 2025,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1366,"ABSTRACTCondition-based preventive maintenance (CB-PM), dependent on robust and precise indicators of equipment quality, stands to gain advantages from the integration of sensor technologies. Yet, the effectiveness of such systems relies on an important factor: people. Even in possession of ideal CB-PM policies, imperfect adherence can lead to higher equipment downtime, maintenance costs, and increased safety hazards. Here, we describe a normative model of optimal CB-PM policy determination; specifically, a generalized means by which to determine a valuemaximizing quality threshold as a guideline for triggering PM (preventative maintenance). Motivated by field data, we consider the opportunity cost of not adhering to such optimal policies; that is, premature or delayed responses. We design and execute a controlled laboratory study, exposing participants to two critical manipulations that we theorize might influence adherence: (1) The presence of a supplemental secondary signal, of a type common to time-based preventive maintenance (TB-PM), (2) a pre-task priming intended to emphasize the value of discretized task completion. Results showed that the combination of CB-PM and TB-PM signals, along with completion priming, significantly increases adherence to CB-PM guidelines. We demonstrate that individuals exposed to this combination of treatments forfeit far less value than those receiving CB-PM signals alone."

An empirically grounded analytical approach to hog farm finishing stage management: Deep reinforcement learning as decision support and managerial learning tool,Panos Kouvelis,18 December 2024,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1342,"AbstractIn hog farming, optimizing hog sales is a complex challenge due to uncertain factors, such as hog availability, market prices, and operating costs. This study uses a Markov Decision Process (MDP) to model these decisions, revealing the importance of the final weeks in profit management. The MDP's intractability due to the curse of dimensionality leads us to employ Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for optimization. Using real-world and synthetic data, our DRL model outperforms existing practices. However, it lacks interpretability, hindering trust and legal compliance in the food industry. To address this, we introduce “managerial learning,” extracting actionable insights from DRL outputs using classification trees that would have been difficult to obtain otherwise. We leverage these insights to devise a smart heuristic that significantly beats the heuristic currently used in practice. This study has broader implications for operations management, where DRL can solve complex dynamic optimization problems that are often intractable due to dimensionality. By applying methods, such as classification trees and DRL, one can scrutinize solutions for actionable managerial insights that can enhance existing practices with straightforward planning guidelines."
Encounter Decisions for Patients With Diverse Sociodemographic Characteristics: Predictive Analytics of EMR Data From a Large Chain of Clinics,Ujjal Kumar Mukherjee,28 March 2025,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1363,"ABSTRACTManaging chronic diabetes care is a major challenge faced by healthcare organizations because it requires resource commitment over a long duration, high levels of patient engagement in the care process, and the socioeconomic and racial diversity of the patient population significantly affect care outcomes. Therefore, it is important to personalize chronic care treatment to improve chronic care outcomes. We propose a decision framework for the predictive management of diabetes that can help reduce the population-level risk of diabetes. We use machine learning on clinical measures, demographics, and socioeconomic status of a large patient population from a chain of clinics in the Midwestern United States to predict the future health conditions of individual diabetes patients. Furthermore, we use the predictive analytic model outcome to build a decision analytic framework to optimally allocate encounters to individual patients. Also, we propose a heuristic solution to the optimal resource allocation model for implementation purposes. We make theoretical and methodological contributions by identifying and combining clinical, demographic, and socioeconomic factors to predict future diabetes risk for patients and demonstrate the use of the predicted risks for optimal resource utilization. Another significant contribution is demonstrating that a data-driven predictive encounter allocation, considering the socioeconomic and demographic factors influencing health risks across patient populations, can promote more equitable healthcare delivery. Finally, we discuss implementation issues and actions."
"Survive the economic downturn: Operating flexibility, productivity, and stock crash",Yang Li,15 December 2024,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1344,"AbstractOperating flexibility supports a firm's resilience strategy during challenging times by enabling them to promptly cut down operating costs associated with unproductive resources. We employ a real options model to formalize this insight. Our empirically grounding analytics motivate a firm-level proxy for downscale operating flexibility (FLEX), which effectively captures the adjustment frictions across different contexts of firms' operations. Using U.S. data between 1961 and 2020, we show that operating flexibility mitigates the risk of stock price crashes, especially during periods of economic recession. Consistent with the loss-curtailment mechanism, the operating flexibility effect is more pronounced for firms with lower productivity/profitability or higher operating leverage and is further amplified during longer and more severe recessions. Managers may avail themselves of our well-tested empirical measure of operating flexibility to guide their efforts in building a more resilient operations structure."
Beyond the Yield: Enhancing Agricultural Sustainability Through Operations Management,Christian F. Durach,15 May 2025,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1375,
Switching the Telescope Lens: A Sociomaterial Perspective of Sustainable Agricultural (Proto)Practices Transfer in an Agrifood Supply Chain,Minelle E. Silva,12 May 2025,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1369,"ABSTRACTThis study investigates the implementation and transfer of sustainable agricultural practices (SUSAPs) across a multitier agrifood supply chain (SC) using Brazilian poultry farming as the empirical context. We conduct an interpretive case study of buyer–supplier–subsupplier triads, including those certified under Global Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) and noncertified counterparts, using interviews, observations, and secondary data. Adopting a sociomaterial perspective, we investigate how SUSAPs' components—meanings, materials, and competencies—are embedded within specific SC tiers and transferred across the triad. A zoom-in analysis reveals that only animal welfare is a fully adopted practice, whereas waste management, working conditions, and biosecurity remain in development as protopractices. A zoom-out analysis of SUSAPs' components shows limited buyer influence across the triad, while first-tier suppliers facilitate SUSAP transfer. We advance theory by demonstrating how a sociomaterial perspective explains the degree of SUSAPs' implementation and transfer, and introducing theboomerang effect, illustrating how first-tier suppliers enable SUSAP implementation among certified and noncertified subsuppliers to ensure safer and more sustainable products. These insights help managers transfer SUSAPs into their SCs by leveraging first-tier suppliers as boundary spanners."
From Power to Sustainability? Unpacking the Role of Justice in Agricultural Commodity Supply Networks,Felipe Alexandre de Lima,12 May 2025,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1372,"ABSTRACTAgricultural commodity supply networks in the Global South are essential for securing the global supply of crops and livestock. However, they are challenged by power asymmetries, which cause injustice and jeopardize social equity, environmental stewardship, and economic viability for disadvantaged actors. To address this challenge, it is imperative to understand how power impacts justice and sustainability. To this end, we examined a supply network in Mato Grosso, Brazil, that faced power asymmetries through 49 semi-structured interviews, field observations, and archival data. The analysis unveiled three forms of power use—excessive, strategic, and balanced—and associated tactics, impacting justice and sustainability outcomes in various ways. We illustrate, for example, how excessive power manifested in traders' abusive tactics, who compelled farmers to accept quality discounts due to external factors, such as heavy rain or poor road conditions. In response to these injustices, farmers cascaded the pressure through the supply network, disproportionately affecting disadvantaged actors, for instance, by withholding rural workers' wages for low productivity or eradicating wildlife deemed detrimental to profitability. Based on these findings, we provide a set of six propositions and a theoretical model that elucidate how power can be leveraged to foster fairer and more sustainable agricultural commodity supply networks."

"Convergence of Product, Production, and Supply Chain Design Rules: Evidence From Pharmaceutical Pre-Competitive Collaboration Networks",Jagjit Singh Srai,26 February 2025,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1352,"ABSTRACTWe address a trans-specialist learning and coordination question in pre-competitive manufacturing R&D networks: how do early-stage consortia develop products across “dissimilar” (where knowledge requirements are different, and not solely based within) specialized networks? A unique aspect of the R&D consortia is that they integrate knowledge across product, production, and supply chain domains. This paper uses network ethnography as the methodology—in combining social network analysis with ethnographic methods—while drawing on a 10-year dataset on the evolution of pre-competitive collaboration networks in pharmaceutical continuous manufacturing deploying digital technologies. Our analysis reveals mechanisms through which design rules for products and processes are developed and converged across product, production, and supply chain domains. Specifically, we show that design rules, which are both “set-based” and “trans-specialized”, are the key mechanisms that enable heterogeneous specialist stakeholders to exchange knowledge and facilitate the convergence of development efforts. Second, we highlight the roles of boundary spanners and institutional actors (i.e., academia and regulatory bodies) in steering dialogues towards the convergence of design rules in early-stage R&D settings. The theoretical implications of these findings are not only germane to pharmaceutical drug development networks but also to early-stage product and technology development networks at large."
Evaluating quality reward and other interventions to mitigate US drug shortages,Sergey Naumov,08 October 2024,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1334,"AbstractDrug shortages have been persistent in the United States for over a decade, posing serious threats to public health and the healthcare system. While previous research has investigated the causes and effects of drug shortages, there is a dearth of research exploring potential solutions to mitigate this problem. Using a system dynamics model of the US generic drug market, we evaluate the long-term effectiveness of two existing policy interventions (expediting drug approvals and nudging manufacturers to ramp up their production) and the “quality reward” initiative that is being actively explored by the FDA and industry. Our results indicate that while the existing interventions can be helpful in addressing shortages, their long-term effect seems limited. In contrast, quality reward can mitigate drug shortages in a sustainable way. However, a caveat of quality reward is the potential emergence of a monopolistic supply market with negative consequences. We suggest that a carefully designed quality disclosure mechanism can address this issue. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to quantitatively and comparatively evaluate the long-term effectiveness of quality reward and other interventions on drug shortages and provide structural explanations for their performance."
Supply Base attributes and diversion risk in a supply chain for hazardous pharmaceutical products,Paul F. Skilton,27 October 2024,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1335,"AbstractWe develop a novel construct, diversion risk, defined as the potential for post-retail diversion that results from increased sales of hazardous goods. We examine diversion risk in the context of prescription opioid sales in the United States. We ask how supply base attributes and nonprofit ownership influence the creation of opioid diversion risk. We use performance-outcome expectancy theory to hypothesize that pharmacies organize supply bases to help them avoid negative evaluations and that nonprofit ownership alters expectancy concerning legal but questionable behavior. We develop and test multilevel hypotheses explaining how supply base complexity, chain size, and nonprofit ownership influence diversion risk. Our analysis of DEA data from 2006 to 2019 finds that after accounting for other attributes, supply base complexity is positively related to diversion risk, within and between firms. Retail chain size is negatively related to diversion risk in the within-firm model, but positively in the between firm model. Testing our nonprofit hypothesis reveals that nonprofit pharmacies also use size and supply base complexity to manage diversion risk. This research sheds light on the dynamics of diversion risk in pharmaceutical supply chains. It has practical implications for the industry, potentially informing future policy and practice addressing this critical issue."
Towards the Integration of Precision Medicine in Psychiatric Care Delivery: Evaluating the Impact of Clinical Guidelines on Drug-Related Adverse Events,Jingwen Yang,11 March 2025,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1353,"ABSTRACTDespite the immense potential of precision medicine to revolutionize healthcare, its integration into routine clinical practice remains a significant challenge. This study investigates the impact of Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines, which provide synthesized evidence and pharmacogenetics-based drug dosing recommendations, on the delivery of psychiatric care enabled by precision medicine. Specifically, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the effect of CPIC guidelines on serious drug-related adverse events and explore how drug characteristics related to therapeutic uncertainty, namely drug age and drug label warning, moderate this effect. Our findings suggest that the availability of CPIC guidelines is associated with almost a 25% decrease in serious drug-related adverse events in the context of psychiatric care delivery enabled by precision medicine. Furthermore, we find that the presence of drug label warning, as FDA-endorsed negative news on pharmacogenetics-related drug use, enhances the effect of CPIC guidelines and is associated with a further decrease in serious drug-related adverse events. Post hoc analysis reveals that CPIC guidelines with high strength of evidence are associated with a significant decrease in serious drug-related adverse events, while no such effect is observed for guidelines with low strength of evidence. These findings contribute to the nascent literature on integrating precision medicine into routine clinical practice, highlighting the consequential role of clinical guidelines in improving the effectiveness of psychiatric care delivery for individual patients enabled by precision medicine. In addition, by demonstrating how the development and implementation of robust clinical guidelines are central to minimizing serious drug-related adverse events, the findings have policy implications for minimizing the downside risks of psychiatric care delivery."
"Innovations, Technologies, and the Economics of Last-Mile Operations: A Call for Research in Operations Management",Niels Agatz,25 February 2025,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1355,
Last-minute coordination: Adapting to demand to support last-mile operations,Kedong Chen,15 February 2024,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1297,"AbstractIn the highly competitive e-commerce industry, customer-facing warehouses are crucial as the “order penetration points” for e-commerce last-mile operations. This research examines how warehouses use last-minute coordination, an unstructured mechanism, to ensure sufficient inventory at the order penetration points. Previous research has focused on structured mechanisms like contracts and inventory management systems to enhance warehouse performance. However, these mechanisms can be ineffective when faced with unforeseen local contingencies. To adjust inventory and adapt to changes in supply and/or demand, warehouses need to engage in unstructured, last-minute coordination with other warehouses. Using coordination and loose coupling theories, we find that coordinating with many warehouses (i.e., large coordination scope) reduces the operational efficiency of individual warehouses. At the network level, we find that a centralized coordination structure improves the operational efficiency of the entire network. We also show that demand uncertainty reinforces the existing last-minute coordination patterns, using the Separable Temporal Exponential Random Graph Model (ST-ERGM). This research highlights the importance of last-minute coordination and reveals its effects on both individual warehouses and the overall network."
Targeting online sales through last-mile delivery platform integration,Kevin H. Park,09 November 2024,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1338,"AbstractWe analyze channel integration between a last-mile delivery platform and a general merchandise retailer in two distinct stages: (1) platform delivery access (PDA), where the retailer continues to offer standard delivery through its own website but directs customers to the platform's website for new same-day delivery; and (2) integrated delivery access (IDA), where customers can continue to use same-day delivery service at the delivery platform website but can purchase products in a single order with both same-day and standard delivery options at the retailer's website. We perform a quasi-experiment using consumer spending data from retailer, target, and delivery platform, Shipt. We find that PDA provides positive impacts to the delivery platform through increased sales. IDA, on the other hand, increases the retailer's online channel sales but does not impact the delivery platform's sales. Moreover, we find that the positive effects of PDA on the delivery platform's sales are stronger in markets where online grocery penetration is lower, indicating that the effects were likely driven by increased purchases for groceries. Finally, the positive effect of IDA on the retailer's online channel sales is stronger in markets where the retailer has a greater loyal customer base and online grocery penetration is lower."
Faster Deliveries and Smarter Order Assignments for an On-Demand Meal Delivery Platform,Wenzheng Mao,20 February 2025,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1354,"ABSTRACTThe rapid growth of on-demand meal delivery platforms has heightened competition, making customer retention a critical priority. While prior research on order dispatch algorithms has largely focused on minimizing delivery time or delay, the direct impact of delivery performance on repeat purchases remains underexplored. Using transactional data from an online meal delivery platform in China, we empirically investigate the asymmetric effects of early and late deliveries on customer repurchasing behavior. To address potential endogeneity, we introduce driver experience and local knowledge, two previously overlooked factors in platform algorithms, as novel instrumental variables. The survival analysis shows that late deliveries significantly reduce future orders, while early deliveries provide only limited benefits. Guided by these empirical insights, we develop a simulation-based evaluation of different order dispatch algorithms, revealing that maximizing future orders, rather than minimizing delivery time or delays, yields the highest future orders. These insights offer actionable recommendations for platform managers, stressing the importance of strategic adjustments in dispatch algorithms and integrating heterogeneous treatment effects into algorithmic design. By merging operational delivery performance with consumer behavior insights through causal inference and optimization, this study provides a novel end-to-end framework for creating data-driven dispatch algorithms that enhance both service efficiency and customer retention."
"Real-time demands, restaurant density, and delivery reliability: An empirical analysis of on-demand meal delivery",Xiaohan Li,07 November 2024,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1339,"AbstractA surge in technological advancements and innovations has spurred the rise of on-demand meal delivery platforms. Despite their widespread appeal, these platforms face two critical challenges (i.e., order batching and demand allocation) in effectively managing the delivery process while maintaining reliability. In response, this study aims to address these two challenges by examining the effects of real-time demands and restaurant density on delivery reliability, as well as how the type of driver (i.e., in-house versus crowdsourced drivers) moderates these effects. We evaluated our model with a unique dataset obtained from one of the top three on-demand meal delivery platforms in China, and our research sheds light on several key findings. Specifically, our study finds inverted U-shaped relationships between real-time demands and delivery reliability and a positive relationship between restaurant density and delivery reliability. In addition, it reveals that crowdsourced drivers perform better than in-house drivers under high real-time demands. This study contributes to the literature by clarifying how delivery reliability can be influenced by real-time demands and restaurant density. The results offer important implications for on-demand meal delivery platforms to improve delivery performance and allocate demands amid complicated market conditions."

Examining the role of single versus dual decision-making approach for patient care: Evidence from cardiology patients,Deepa Goradia,17 November 2024,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1340,"AbstractResearch in healthcare suggests that repeated interaction between a provider and a patient can support better decision-making, resulting in improved efficiencies. To date, these repeated interactions enabling continuity of care have not been studied in hospital inpatient settings. During a hospital stay, decisions related to patient treatment are usually made by two key decision-makers: the attending physician (AP) and the operating physician (OP). Under the single decision-making approach (S-DMA), the AP and OP are the same; in contrast, under the dual decision-making approach (D-DMA), the AP and OP are different. In recent years, there has been an increasing trend toward the use of D-DMA over S-DMA across U.S. hospitals owing to scheduling conflicts. Although research outside healthcare operations management has argued for benefits from both approaches, their impacts on a patient's hospital stay are unclear. In this study, we address this gap by investigating the effects of S-DMA and D-DMA on patient care outcomes in terms of patient length of stay (LOS), treatment cost, and mortality. Data for our study come from the state of Florida and involve 520,554 cardiology patients treated by 9483 APs and 18,398 OPs at 241 hospitals between 2014 and 2016. We account for both patient and physician selection issues when choosing a particular decision-making strategy. Our results suggest that, on average, using S-DMA is associated with reduced patient LOS and treatment cost but has no effect on mortality. We also find that S-DMA is more beneficial for patients with low comorbidity and low process uncertainty, whereas D-DMA is more beneficial for patients with high comorbidity and high process uncertainty. Our results are robust to alternative explanations. We demonstrate that a single decision-maker offers benefits in the context of healthcare delivery, but dual decision-makers may yield benefits when caring for patients with high comorbidity and high process complexity. We discuss the implications of these findings for appropriately deploying S-DMA and D-DMA in inpatient services."
Innovation intermediation in supply networks: Addressing shortfalls in buyer and supplier capabilities for collaborative innovation,Kostas Selviaridis,19 December 2024,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1345,"AbstractWe investigate how innovation intermediaries address shortfalls in the capabilities that buyers and suppliers must have to access each other's knowledge for innovation purposes, also referred to as indirect capabilities. Prior research on supplier-enabled innovation has identified various capabilities that buyers need in order to collaborate with innovative suppliers. It recognizes that suppliers also require capabilities to access buyer knowledge. However, we still know little about the role of innovation intermediaries—actors who are neither buyers nor suppliers, but still influence innovation processes and outcomes in supply networks. Our case-based research shows that intermediaries create workspaces for R&D and experimentation, help to refine definitions of requirements and de-risk novel solutions, support contracting, and facilitate solution implementation. We contribute to research on supplier innovation by developing a model of intermediaries' activities and underlying capabilities, and their impact on innovation sourcing outcomes. We elaborate the indirect capabilities theoretical perspective by introducing additional types of indirect capabilities for collaborative innovation in supply chains, and showing how these capabilities interrelate. We furthermore extend the literature on innovation intermediaries by elucidating hitherto unexplored capabilities for intermediation and adding insights regarding the contribution of intermediaries to open innovation processes."
The point of no return? Restrictive changes to lenient return policies and consumer reactions to them,Huseyn Abdulla,15 December 2024,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1346,"AbstractRetailers face a challenging trade-off in maintaining versus restricting long-established lenient return policies. On the one hand, lenient return policies have become an important part of retailers' value propositions and play a significant role in stimulating consumer purchases. On the other hand, lenient return policies increase the volume of product returns, which hurts profitability. Motivated by observing an increase in restrictive changes to long-established lenient return policies, we investigate consumer reactions to such changes and their managerial implications. Through a series of experiments with diverse consumer samples, we find that restrictive changes, such as shortening return time windows or introducing restocking fees, decrease consumer trust in retailers and lead to lowered purchase, positive word-of-mouth, and loyalty intentions. We also find that providing managerial transparency, in the form of communicating the rationale for restrictive changes, can attenuate the negative consumer reactions to such changes. Moreover, rationales that emphasize the cost of handling returns versus blaming opportunistic and abusive returners are similarly effective. Our findings contribute to the growing academic literature on consumer return policy design and provide actionable insights to retail managers."
When Complexity Meets Complexity: COVID-19-Induced Supply Chain Disruptions and Strategy Portfolio Efficiency,Hakan Yildiz,29 December 2024,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1347,"ABSTRACTDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, global supply chains have experienced sustained impacts from unprecedented complex disruptions in different combinations and at different times. From an efficiency perspective, do these complex supply chain disruptions call for more complex risk management strategies? To answer this, we built an empirically grounded discrete event simulation model, the results of which were analyzed using data envelopment analysis. Results show that with unprecedented complex disruption patterns, a multi-strategy portfolio approach is usually less efficient than a single-strategy or a do-nothing approach unless the strategy portfolio has certain characteristics. The most efficient strategy portfolios typically consist of a moderate number of diverse strategies. Too many strategies in a portfolio can be problematic, leading to increased costs that outpace improvement in revenue and service level. Results illustrate that even a strategy that generally performs poorly can be part of a very good strategy portfolio and vice versa. This study provides nuanced and novel findings that contribute to the resolution of the literature debate about the value of multi-strategy portfolios in addressing complex disruption patterns. Highlighting the value of a strategy portfolio view, these insights help firms better prepare for the next complex and sustained global supply chain disruptions."
To Fill a Hollow Core: Roles of Firm Knowledge When Outsourcing Core Component During Technological Change,Woo-Yong Park,17 February 2025,Journal of Operations Management,,/doi/10.1002/joom.1349,"ABSTRACTThe innovation literature has been marked by contrarian views regarding the roles of firms' knowledge accumulation with regards to outsourced core components. To reconcile these views, we draw on the behavioral theory of the firm and the technological evolution literature in hypothesizing firms' local search as a mechanism by which firms' accumulated knowledge affects their product performance. Firms' in-house knowledge can expose them to anaccumulated knowledge trap, as firms' accumulated knowledge tends to escalate their local search for a solution to a new technological challenge, but the impact of the local search on performance is unlikely to be materialized. We maintain that firms' accumulated knowledge can make them more prone to the accumulated knowledge trapbeforerather thanafterthe dominant technology has emerged. We further hypothesize that prior exploratory experiences and suppliers' outsourced component knowledge can reduce firms' susceptibility to such a knowledge trapbeforethe dominant technology emergence, but their moderating roles fade awayafterthe dominant technology emergence. Data from the U.S. Hybrid Electric Vehicle drivetrain market support our hypotheses. Our findings enrich the current literatures on the behavioral theory of the firm and technological evolution while reconciling the contrarian views in the innovation literature."
Contractibility and Transparency of Financial Statement Information Prepared Under IFRS: Evidence from Debt Contracts Around IFRS Adoption,RAY BALL,10 September 2015,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12095,"ABSTRACTWe outline several properties of IFRS that potentially affect the contractibility or the transparency of financial statement information, and hence the use of that information in debt contracts. Those properties include the increased choice among accounting rules IFRS gives to managers, enhanced rule-making uncertainty, and increased emphasis on fair value accounting. Consistent with reduced contractibility of IFRS financial statement information, we find a significant reduction in accounting-based debt covenants following mandatory IFRS adoption. The reduction in accounting covenant use is associated with measures of the difference between prior domestic standards and IFRS. Because IFRS adoption changed financial reporting in many ways simultaneously, it is difficult to trace the decline in accounting covenant use to individual IFRS properties, though we report larger declines in accounting covenant use in banks, which have a higher proportion of assets and liabilities that are fair-valued. Our findings are better explained by reduced contractibility than by increased transparency, which would predict reduced nonaccounting covenant use as well, whereas we observe increases. Overall, we conclude that IFRS rules sacrifice debt contracting usefulness to achieve other objectives, such as provision of accounting information relevant to valuation."
Asset Measurement in Imperfect Credit Markets,JEREMY BERTOMEU,16 September 2015,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12096,"ABSTRACTHow should a firm measure a productive asset used as collateral? To answer this question, we develop a model in which firms borrow funds subject to collateral constraints. We characterize the qualities of optimal asset measurements and analyze their interactions with financing needs, collateral constraints, and interest rates. Because of real effects, complete transparency would reduce contracting efficiency and, hence, the measurement must be suitably adapted to credit conditions. The optimal measurement is asymmetric and reports precise information about high collateral values if credit frictions are low, but the reverse if credit frictions are high. Tighter credit market conditions may lead to more opaque measurements and increased investment, in the form of inefficient continuations."
Think Twice Before Going for Incentives: Social Norms and the Principal's Decision on Compensation Contracts,EDDY CARDINAELS,02 September 2015,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12093,"ABSTRACTPrincipals make decisions on various issues, ranging from contract design to control system implementation. Few studies examine the principal's active role in these decisions. We experimentally investigate this role by studying how a principal's choice of an incentive contract that may discourage misrepresentation, compared to a fixed-salary contract, affects the honesty of his or her agents’ cost reporting. Results show that, besides an incentive effect and a principal trust effect, the active choice for incentives produces a negative “information leakage” effect. When principals use incentives, their choices not only incentivize truthful reporting and signal distrust, but they also leak important information about the social norm, namely, that other agents are likely to report dishonestly. Agents conform to this social norm by misrepresenting cost information more. Our results have important practical implications. Managers must recognize that their decisions can leak information to their agents, which may produce unanticipated consequences for the social norms of the organization."
A New Measure of Disclosure Quality: The Level of Disaggregation of Accounting Data in Annual Reports,SHUPING CHEN,02 September 2015,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12094,"ABSTRACTWe construct a new, parsimonious, measure of disclosure quality—disaggregation quality (DQ)—and offer validation tests. DQ captures the level of disaggregation of accounting data through a count of nonmissing Compustat line items, and reflects the extent of details in firms’ annual reports. Conceptually, DQ differs from existing disclosure measures in that it captures the “fineness” of data and is based on a comprehensive set of accounting line items in annual reports. Unlike existing measures, which are usually applicable for a subset of firms or are based on a subset of information items, DQ can be generated for the universe of Compustat industrial firms. We conduct three sets of validation tests by examining DQ's association with variables predicted by prior literature to be associated with information quality. DQ is negatively (positively) associated with analyst forecast dispersion (accuracy) and negatively associated with bid-ask spreads and cost of equity. These associations continue to hold after we control for firm fundamentals. Taken together, results from this battery of validation tests are consistent with our measure capturing disclosure quality."
The Moderating Effect of Relative Performance Evaluation on the Risk Incentive Properties of Executives’ Equity Portfolios,HYUNGSHIN PARK,23 September 2015,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12092,"ABSTRACTWe offer evidence that the use of relative performance evaluation (RPE) in CEOs’ incentive contracts influences the effect of risk-taking incentives on both the magnitude and composition of firm risk. We find that, when the incentive designlacksRPE features, the incentive portfolio vega motivates CEOs to increase total risk through the systematic component because it can be hedged. In contrast, when the incentive designincludesRPE features, CEOs prefer idiosyncratic risk because RPE filters out the systematic component of firm performance. We also document that the use of RPE reinforces the incentive portfolio vega's effect on the total risk."
Issuer Operating Performance and IPO Price Formation,MICHAEL WILLENBORG,23 July 2015,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12091,"ABSTRACTWe study the relation between issuer operating performance and initial public offering (IPO) price formation from the initial price range to the offer price to the closing price on the first trading day. For a post-bubble sample of 2001–2013 IPOs, we find that pre-IPO net income and, in particular, operating cash flow are strongly, positively associated with the revision from the mid-point of the initial price range to the offer price and that the “partial adjustment phenomenon” concentrates among issuers with the strongest operating performance. As for why publicly observable information helps predict changes in valuation from when the initial price range is set to when the offer price is set, our findings suggest that strong-performing issuers, especially those offering small slices of ownership, have lower bargaining incentives and are susceptible to the underwriter(s) low-balling the price range. Overall, our results suggest an important role for accounting information in understanding the pricing of book-built IPOs and are consistent with the presence of agency problems between issuers and underwriters."
Are Employee Selection and Incentive Contracts Complements or Substitutes?,MARGARET A. ABERNETHY,12 June 2015,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12090,"ABSTRACTThere is a debate in the literature as to whether employee selection is a substitute or complement to incentive contracting. We argue that incentive contracts and selection can be both complements and substitutes conditional on the contracting difficulty faced by the firm. We examine these control choices in a setting where contracting difficulties arise due to the firm's choice of strategy and from the volatility created by the firm's external environment. We select a firm's commitment to organizational learning (OL) as our strategic choice variable as this provides a useful proxy for identifying settings where explicit incentive contracting is difficult. The results show that, as firms become increasingly committed to OL, incentive contracts and employee selection operate as complements. However, with a high commitment to OL and an increasing level of external volatility, contracting on performance measures will become less effective. In this context, our results indicate that there is a substitution effect toward employee selection."
Segment Disclosure Transparency and Internal Capital Market Efficiency: Evidence from SFAS No. 131,YOUNG JUN CHO,09 June 2015,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12089,"ABSTRACTUsing the adoption of SFAS 131, I examine the effect of segment disclosure transparency on internal capital market efficiency. SFAS 131 requires firms to define segments as internally viewed by managers, thereby improving the transparency of managerial actions in internal capital allocation. I find that diversified firms that improved segment disclosure transparency by changing segment definitions upon adoption of SFAS 131 experienced an improvement in capital allocation efficiency in internal capital markets after the adoption of SFAS 131. In addition, I find that the improvement in internal capital market efficiency was greater for firms that suffered more severe agency problems before the adoption of SFAS 131 and also for firms whose managers faced stronger incentives to improve efficiency after the adoption of SFAS 131. My results suggest that more transparent segment information can help resolve agency conflicts in the internal capital markets of diversified firms, thus improving investment efficiency."
Competition in the Audit Market: Policy Implications,JOSEPH GERAKOS,22 April 2015,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12087,"ABSTRACTThe audit market's unique combination of features—its role in capital market transparency, mandated demand, and concentrated supply—means it receives considerable attention from policy makers. We explore the effects of two market scenarios that have been the focus of policy discussions: mandatory audit firm rotation and further supply concentration due to the exit of a “Big 4” audit firm. To do so, we first estimate publicly traded firms' demand for auditing services, allowing the services provided by each of the Big 4 to be differentiated products. We then use those estimates to calculate how each scenario would affect client firms' consumer surplus. We estimate that, for U.S. publicly trade firms, mandatory audit firm rotation would induce consumer surplus losses of approximately $2.7 billion if rotation were required after 10 years and $4.7–5.0 billion if after only four years. We find similarly that exit by one of the Big 4 would reduce client firms' surplus by $1.4–1.8 billion. These estimates reflect only the value of firms' lost options to hire the exiting audit firm; they do not include likely fee increases resulting from less competition among audit firms. The latter could result in audit fee increases between $0.75–1.3 billion per year for mandatory rotation and $0.47–0.58 billion per year for the disappearance of a Big 4 audit firm. Such losses are substantial; by comparison, total audit fees for public firms were $11 billion in 2010."
Taxes and Financial Constraints: Evidence from Linguistic Cues,KELVIN K. F. LAW,18 March 2015,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12081,"ABSTRACTUsing a new measure of financial constraints based on firms’ qualitative disclosures, we find that financially constrained firms—firms that use more negative words in their annual reports—pursue more aggressive tax planning strategies as evidenced by: (1) higher current and future unrecognized tax benefits, (2) lower short- and long-run current and future effective tax rates, (3) increase in tax haven usage for their material operations, and (4) higher proposed audit adjustments from the Internal Revenue Service. We exploit the unexpected closures of local banks as exogenous liquidity shocks to show that firms’ external financial constraints affect their tax avoidance strategies. Overall, the linguistic cues in firms’ qualitative disclosures provide incremental information beyond traditional accounting variables or commonly used effective tax rates to reveal and predict tax aggressiveness, both contemporaneously and in the future."
Do Analyst Stock Recommendations Piggyback on Recent Corporate News? An Analysis of Regular-Hour and After-Hours Revisions,EDWARD XUEJUN LI,08 April 2015,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12083,"ABSTRACTAnalysts often update their recommendations following corporate news. Questions have been raised regarding analysts’ ability to generate new information beyond recent corporate events. Employing a comprehensive database on corporate news, we show that only a small minority, or 27.9%, of all recommendation revisions directionally confirm the information in the preceding corporate events and even these “confirming revisions” facilitate the information discovery of corporate events and thus cannot simply be dismissed as “piggybacking.” Our analysis further shows that analysts not only facilitate price discovery to corporate news through issuing trending revisions but also help reverse prevailing market sentiments following corporate news by issuing contrarian revisions. Our study is the first to investigate short-window intraday market reactions to revisions issued after hours, which account for 70% of all recommendation revisions in our sample period. Analysts’ incentives to issue revisions after hours appear to reflect demands from large institutional clients, who dominate after-hours trading. More importantly, we show that the after-hours revisions are associated with significantly greater price reactions and different price reaction patterns than revisions issued during regular trading hours. Collectively, our evidence indicates that analysts are a significant source of new information beyond recent corporate news and they also help shape the market's assessment of corporate disclosures."
Do Improvements in the Information Environment Enhance Insiders’ Ability to Learn from Outsiders?,GILBERTO LOUREIRO,02 April 2015,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12082,"ABSTRACTWe examine whether and how an exogenous shock to the information environment changes insiders’ ability to learn from outsiders. We document three main findings. First, we find an increase in investment-to-price sensitivity following the adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Second, we show that the relation between the market reaction to M&A deal announcements and the likelihood of deal completion becomes stronger after IFRS adoption. Third, we find significant improvements in post-acquisition operating and stock return performance post-IFRS adoption. These results are more pronounced for firms that experienced significant increases in foreign institutional ownership around IFRS adoption, especially when these foreign investors are from countries that matter for the firm’s growth opportunities. Taken together, our findings suggest that insiders’ ability to learn from outsiders improves post-IFRS, and this improved ability to learn from outsiders leads to real economic gains."
"Audit Firm Tenure, Non-Audit Services, and Internal Assessments of Audit Quality",TIMOTHY B. BELL,10 March 2015,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12078,"ABSTRACTWe use data from internal assessments of audit quality in a Big 4 firm to investigate the impact of audit firm tenure and auditor-provided non-audit services (NAS) on audit quality. We find that first-year audits receive lower assessments of audit quality and that quality improves shortly thereafter and then declines as tenure becomes very long. Partitioning our sample between SEC registrants and private clients, we find that the decline in audit quality in the long tenure range is attributable to audits of private clients. For audits of SEC registrants, the probability of a high quality audit reaches its maximum with very long tenure. We also find that audit fees are discounted for first-year audits but auditor effort is higher than in subsequent years. We find no association, on average, between total NAS fees and audit quality in the full sample but observe that total NAS fees are positively associated with quality for SEC registrants and negatively associated with quality for privately held clients. Our findings are important for regulatory policies related to audit firm tenure and auditor-provided NAS."
Delayed Expected Loss Recognition and the Risk Profile of Banks,ROBERT M. BUSHMAN,13 March 2015,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12079,"ABSTRACTThis paper investigates the extent to which delayed expected loan loss recognition (DELR) is associated with greater vulnerability of banks to three distinct dimensions of risk: (1) stock market liquidity risk, (2) downside tail risk of individual banks, and (3) codependence of downside tail risk among banks. We hypothesize thatDELRincreases vulnerability to downside risk by creating expected loss overhangs that threaten future capital adequacy and by degrading bank transparency, which increases financing frictions and opportunities for risk-shifting. We find thatDELRis associated with higher correlations between bank-level illiquidity and both aggregate banking sector illiquidity and market returns (i.e., higher liquidity risks) during recessions, suggesting that highDELRbanks as a group may simultaneously face elevated financing frictions and enhanced opportunities for risk-shifting behavior in crisis periods. With respect to downside risk, we find that during recessionsDELRis associated with significantly higher risk of individual banks suffering severe drops in their equity values, where this association is magnified for banks with low capital levels. Consistent with increased systemic risk, we find thatDELRis associated with significantly higher codependence between downside risk of individual banks and downside risk of the banking sector. We theorize that downside risk vulnerability at the individual bank level can translate into systemic risk by virtue ofDELRcreating a common source of risk vulnerability across highDELRbanks simultaneously, which leads to risk codependence among banks and systemic effects from banks acting as part of a herd."
"Earnings Metrics, Information Processing, and Price Efficiency in Laboratory Markets",W. BROOKE ELLIOTT,11 March 2015,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12080,"ABSTRACTAn enduring issue in financial reporting is whether and how salient summary measures of firm performance (“earnings metrics”) affect market price efficiency. In laboratory markets, we test the effects of salient earnings metrics, which vary in how they combine persistent and transitory elements, on investor information search, beliefs about value, offers to trade, and market price efficiency. We find that including transitory elements in salient earnings metrics causes traders to search unnecessarily for further information about these elements and to overestimate their effect on fundamental value relative to a rational benchmark. In contrast, separately displaying persistent elements in earnings increases the accuracy of traders’ value estimates. Prices generally reflect traders’ beliefs about value, and prices are most efficient when transitory elements are excluded from earnings metrics entirely. Our study contributes to research on salience effects in financial reporting by showing that including transitory elements in salient earnings metrics causes inefficient information search and biased beliefs about value that can aggregate to affect market prices. We also contribute to research in experimental markets by showing that redundant disclosure is not always beneficial; redundant disclosure of transitory earnings elements, in particular, appears to have negative consequences for investor behavior and market efficiency."
Foreign Institutional Ownership and the Global Convergence of Financial Reporting Practices,VIVIAN W. FANG,20 February 2015,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12076,"ABSTRACTThis paper investigates whether foreign institutional investors affect the global convergence of financial reporting practices. Using several measures of reporting convergence, we show that U.S. institutional ownership is positively associated with subsequent changes in emerging market firms’ accounting comparability to their U.S. industry peers. We identify this association using an instrumental variable approach that exploits exogenous variation in U.S. institutional investment generated by the JGTRRA Act of 2003. Further, we provide evidence of a specific mechanism—the switch to a Big Four audit firm—through which U.S. institutional investors affect reporting convergence. Finally, we show that, for emerging market firms, an increase in comparability to U.S. firms is associated with an improvement in the properties of foreign analysts’ forecasts."
"The Evolving Disclosure Landscape: How Changes in Technology, the Media, and Capital Markets Are Affecting Disclosure",GREGORY S. MILLER,24 February 2015,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12075,"ABSTRACTRecent changes in technology and the media are causing significant changes in how capital markets assimilate and respond to information. We identify important themes in the disclosure literature and use this as a framework to discuss the conference papers that appear in this volume. These papers examine how managers’ disclosure practices are being affected by changes in technology, the media, and capital markets. While this work makes important progress, we discuss how continuing technological change and the emergence of new forms of media offer further opportunities for research on the role of disclosure in capital markets."
The Structure of Voluntary Disclosure Narratives: Evidence from Tone Dispersion,KRISTIAN D. ALLEE,19 January 2015,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12072,"ABSTRACTWe examine tone dispersion, or the degree to which tone words are spread evenly within a narrative, to evaluate whether narrative structure provides insight into managers’ voluntary disclosures and users’ responses to those disclosures. We find that tone dispersion is associated with current aggregate and disaggregated performance and future performance, managers’ financial reporting decisions, and managers’ incentives and actions to manage perceptions. Furthermore, we find that tone dispersion is associated with analysts’ and investors’ responses to conference call narratives. Our results suggest that tone dispersion both reflects and affects the information that managers convey through their narratives."
Mobile Communication and Local Information Flow: Evidence from Distracted Driving Laws,NERISSA C. BROWN,26 February 2015,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12077,"ABSTRACTWe examine the influence of mobile communication on local information flow and local investor activity using the enforcement of statewide distracted driving restrictions, which are exogenous events that constrain mobile communication while driving. By restricting mobile communication across a potentially sizable set of local individuals, these restrictions could inhibit local information flow and, in turn, the market activity of stocks headquartered in enforcement states. We first document a decline in Google search activity for local stocks when restrictions take effect, suggesting that constraints on mobile communication significantly affect individuals’ information search activity. We further find significant declines in local trading volume when restrictions are enforced. This drop in liquidity is (1) attenuated when laws provide substitutive means of mobile communication and (2) magnified when locals have long car commutes and when their daily commutes overlap with regular exchange hours. Moreover, trading volume suffers the most for local stocks with lower institutional ownership, less analyst coverage, and more intangible information. Additional analyses show lower intraday volume during local commute times when mobile connectivity is constrained. Together, our results suggest that local information and local investors matter in stock markets and that mobile communication is an important mechanism through which these elements operate to affect liquidity and price discovery."
The Governance Effect of the Media's News Dissemination Role: Evidence from Insider Trading,LILI DAI,20 January 2015,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12073,"ABSTRACTWe investigate whether the media plays a role in corporate governance by disseminating news. Using a comprehensive data set of corporate and insider news coverage for the 2001–2012 period, we show that the media reduces insiders’ future trading profits by disseminating news on prior insiders’ trades available from regulatory filings. We find support for three economic mechanisms underlying the disciplining effect of news dissemination: the reduction of information asymmetry, concerns regarding litigation risk, and the impact on insiders’ personal wealth and reputation. Our findings provide new insights into the real effect of news dissemination."
The Role of Social Media in the Capital Market: Evidence from Consumer Product Recalls,LIAN FEN LEE,03 February 2015,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12074,"ABSTRACTWe examine how corporate social media affects the capital market consequences of firms’ disclosure in the context of consumer product recalls. Product recalls constitute a “product crisis” exposing the firm to reputational damage, loss of future sales, and legal liability. During such a crisis it is crucial for the firm to quickly and directly communicate its intended message to a wide network of stakeholders, which, in turn, renders corporate social media a potentially useful channel of disclosure. While we document that corporate social media, on average, attenuates the negative price reaction to recall announcements, the attenuation benefits of corporate social media vary with the level of control the firm has over its social media content. In particular, with the arrival of Facebook and Twitter, firms relinquished complete control over their social media content, and the attenuation benefits of corporate social media, while still significant, lessened. Detailed Twitter analysis confirms that the moderating effect of social media varies with the level of firm involvement and with the amount of control exerted by other users: the negative price reaction to a recall is attenuated by the frequency of tweets by the firm, while exacerbated by the frequency of tweets by other users."
Political Incentives to Suppress Negative Information: Evidence from Chinese Listed Firms,JOSEPH D. PIOTROSKI,05 December 2014,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12071,"ABSTRACTThis paper tests the proposition that politicians and their affiliated firms (i.e., firms operating in their province) temporarily suppress negative information in response to political incentives. We examine the stock price behavior of Chinese listed firms around two visible political events—meetings of the National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party and promotions of high-level provincial politicians—that are expected to asymmetrically increase the costs of releasing bad news. The costs create an incentive for local politicians and their affiliated firms to temporarily restrict the flow of negative information about the companies. The result will be fewer stock price crashes for the affiliated firms during these event windows, followed by an increase in crashes after the event. Consistent with these predictions, we find that the affiliated firms experience a reduction (an increase) in negative stock return skewness before (after) the event. These effects are strongest in the three-month period directly preceding the event, among firms that are more politically connected, and when the province is dominated by faction politics and cronyism. Additional tests document a significant reduction in published newspaper articles about affected firms in advance of these political events, suggestive of a link between our observed stock price behavior and temporary shifts in the listed firms’ information environment."
Inside the “Black Box” of Sell-Side Financial Analysts,LAWRENCE D. BROWN,11 November 2014,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12067,"ABSTRACTOur objective is to penetrate the “black box” of sell-side financial analysts by providing new insights into the inputs analysts use and the incentives they face. We survey 365 analysts and conduct 18 follow-up interviews covering a wide range of topics, including the inputs to analysts’ earnings forecasts and stock recommendations, the value of their industry knowledge, the determinants of their compensation, the career benefits ofInstitutional InvestorAll-Star status, and the factors they consider indicative of high-quality earnings. One important finding is thatprivatecommunication with management is a more useful input to analysts’ earnings forecasts and stock recommendations than their own primary research, recent earnings performance, and recent 10-K and 10-Q reports. Another notable finding is that issuing earnings forecasts and stock recommendations that are well below the consensus often leads to anincreasein analysts’ credibility with their investing clients. We conduct cross-sectional analyses that highlight the impact of analyst and brokerage characteristics on analysts’ inputs and incentives. Our findings are relevant to investors, managers, analysts, and academic researchers."
Auditor Mindsets and Audits of Complex Estimates,EMILY E. GRIFFITH,21 October 2014,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12066,"ABSTRACTAuditors experience significant problems auditing complex accounting estimates, and this increasingly puts financial reporting quality at risk. Based on analyses of the specific errors that auditors commit, we propose that auditors need to be able to think more broadly and incorporate information from a variety of sources in order to improve audit quality for these important accounts. We experimentally demonstrate that a deliberative mindset intervention improves auditors’ ability to identify unreasonable estimates by improving their ability to identify and incorporate into their analyses contradictory information from diverse parts of the audit and improving their ability to think critically about the evidence. We perform additional analyses to demonstrate that our intervention improves auditor performance by causing them to thinkdifferentlyrather than simply to work harder. We demonstrate that critical thinking can improve the identification of unreasonable estimates and, in doing so, we provide new directions for addressing audit quality issues."
"Short Selling Pressure, Stock Price Behavior, and Management Forecast Precision: Evidence from a Natural Experiment",YINGHUA LI,12 November 2014,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12068,"ABSTRACTUsing a natural experiment (Regulation SHO), we show that short selling pressure and consequent stock price behavior have a causal effect on managers’ voluntary disclosure choices. Specifically, we find that managers respond to a positive exogenous shock to short selling pressure and price sensitivity to bad news by reducing the precision of bad news forecasts. This finding on management forecasts appears to be generalizable to other corporate disclosures. In particular, we find that, in response to increased short selling pressure, managers also reduce the readability (or increase the fuzziness) of bad news annual reports. Overall, our results suggest that maintaining the current level of stock prices is an important consideration in managers’ strategic disclosure decisions."
"Analyst Reputation, Communication, and Information Acquisition",XIAOJING MENG,24 November 2014,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12069,"ABSTRACTEarlier studies have shown that reputational concerns tend to reduce agents' opportunistic behavior. However, a recent study by Morris argued that analysts' (experts') reputational concerns may discourage truthful communication when they try to avoid being perceived as being misaligned with investors. In this paper, I examine the effect of reputational concerns on communication in a setting where analysts can choose their precision endogenously. Because both misaligned and aligned analysts want investors to trust their reports in the future, both will aim to build a reputation for being aligned. In equilibrium, aligned analysts will acquire more information than misaligned analysts. As a result, investors may favorably update their beliefs about the analysts' type when the report is proven to be accurate. Therefore, both types of analysts will have reputational incentives to communicate truthfully. The paper also derives conditions under which the analysts' reputational concerns have a nonmonotonic impact on aligned analysts' equilibrium precision choices and investors' welfare."
Unsophisticated Arbitrageurs and Market Efficiency: Overreacting to a History of Underreaction?,JONATHAN A. MILIAN,24 November 2014,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12070,"ABSTRACTPrior research has documented that arbitrage activity significantly reduces or eliminates stock market anomalies. However, if anomalies arise due to unsophisticated investors’ behavioral biases, then these same biases can also apply to unsophisticated arbitrageurs and thereby disrupt the arbitrage process. Consistent with a disruption in the arbitrage process for the post-earnings announcement drift anomaly, I document that the historically positive autocorrelation in firms’ earnings announcement news has become significantly negative for firms with active exchange-traded options. For these easy-to-arbitrage firms, the firms in the highest decile of prior earnings announcement abnormal return (prior earnings surprise), on average, underperform the firms in the lowest decile by 1.59% (1.43%) at their next earnings announcement. Additional analyses are consistent with investors learning about the post-earnings announcement drift anomaly and overcompensating. This study suggests that unsophisticated attempts to profit from a well-known anomaly can significantly reverse a previously documented stock return pattern."
Real Earnings Management in Sales,MICHAEL J. AHEARNE,16 August 2016,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12134,"ABSTRACTWe surveyed 1,638 sales executives across 40 countries regarding their companies’ likelihood of asking sales to perform real earnings management (REM) actions when earnings pressure exists. Using this information, which we refer to as companies’ REM propensities, we study how company characteristics and environmental conditions relate to the responses received. The use of cash-flow incentives for sales personnel and the distribution of interfunctional power in favor of finance rather than sales are both associated with companies’ REM propensities. In addition, we show that sales executives preemptively change their behaviors in anticipation of top management's REM requests. Sales executives working for public companies and companies in the United States reported higher levels of REM propensity. The data also support an association between REM propensity and finance–sales conflict. These findings and others are compared and contrasted with existing empirical and survey-based research on REM throughout the paper."
How Do Experienced Users Evaluate Hybrid Financial Instruments?,SHANA CLOR-PROELL,22 June 2016,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12129,"ABSTRACTHybrid financial instruments contain features of both liabilities and equity. Standard setters continue to struggle with “getting the classification right” for these complex instruments. In this paper, we experimentally test whether the features of hybrid instruments affect the credit-related judgments of experienced finance professionals, even when the hybrid instruments are already classified as liabilities or equity. Our results suggest that getting the classification right is not of primary importance for these experienced users, as they largely rely on the underlying features of the instrument to make their judgments. A second experiment shows that experienced users’ reliance on features generalizes to several features that often characterize hybrid instruments. However, we also find that experienced users vary in their beliefs about which individual features are most important in distinguishing between liabilities and equity. Together, our results highlight the importance of effective disclosure of hybrid instruments’ features."
Biases in Accounting and Nonaccounting Information: Substitutes or Complements?,XU JIANG,12 September 2016,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12153,"ABSTRACTThis paper studies how bias in nonaccounting and in accounting information should be related. Bias in accounting information is modeled, as in some recent literature, as an alteration in the relative information content of accounting numbers. The optimal bias in one type of information is shown to be a complement of the bias in the other type. This result can be applied in various settings to explain a number of phenomena."
If You Want My Advice: Status Motives and Audit Consultations About Accounting Estimates,W. ROBERT KNECHEL,09 September 2016,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12150,"ABSTRACTEffective consultation is critical for improving the audit of estimates. In an experiment where audit managers acted as consultants to other auditors, we examine conditions in which consultants either recommend estimates that differ substantially from advice-seekers’ assessments (contrariness) or recommend narrower reasonable ranges of estimates (precision). Psychology theory argues that both of these attributes can improve estimates. We examine whether these attributes depend on consultants' status motives, that is, the desire to gain respect from or power over others. We find that active status motives lead consultants with higher specialized knowledge to provide recommendations that are less contrary, but more precise. However, consultants increase precision by tightening range bounds in a manner that is not counter to management's preference and thus unlikely to prompt the audit team to challenge the estimate. We also find that higher consultant decision authority constrains precision. Our findings suggest limits to consultation's potential effectiveness in improving estimates. For instance, our findings suggest that firms and standard setters direct consultants to focus scrutiny on the range bound that is most likely to constrain management opportunism."
Voluntary Disclosure with Informed Trading in the IPO Market,PRAVEEN KUMAR,10 August 2016,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12133,"ABSTRACTWe examine voluntary disclosure and capital investment by an informed manager in an initial public offering (IPO) in the presence of informed and uninformed investors. We find that in equilibrium, disclosure ismoreforthcoming—and investment efficiency islower—when a greater fraction of the investment community isalreadyinformed. Moreover, managers disclose more information when the likelihood of an information event is higher, more equity is issued, or the cost of information acquisition is lower. Investment efficiency and the expected level of underpricing are non-monotonic in the likelihood that the manager is privately informed."
Public Information Precision and Coordination Failure: An Experiment,SANJAY BANERJEE,06 May 2016,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12124,"ABSTRACTMore precise public disclosure reduces uncertainty about economic fundamentals, but it can increase uncertainty about other agents' actions, leading to coordination failure. We conducted a laboratory experiment to study the effects of public information precision and strategic complementarity on coordination failure. Information precision is operationalized in terms of “granularity” (level of detail). We found that (1) granular public disclosure, which is disaggregated and precise, increases the likelihood of coordination failure and decreases coordination efficiency when public information is pessimistic about future economic prospects; (2) the deleterious effect of granular disclosure is stronger when strategic complementarity is high; and (3) higher levels of strategic complementarity decrease coordination efficiency. Overall, the observed likelihood of coordination failure is higher and coordination efficiency is lower than predicted by theory. Our findings have implications for the Federal Reserve's decision to publicly disclose detailed stress test results for distressed banks, and the debate on whether the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board should publicly release reports on firm-specific quality-control deficiencies of audit firms."
The Reluctant Analyst,DAN BERNHARDT,30 March 2016,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12120,"ABSTRACTWe estimate the dynamics of recommendations by financial analysts, uncovering the determinants of inertia in their recommendations. We provide overwhelming evidence that analysts revise recommendations reluctantly, introducing frictions to avoid frequent revisions. More generally, we characterize the sources underlying the infrequent revisions that analysts make. Publicly available data matter far less for explaining recommendation dynamics than do the recommendation frictions and the long-lived information that analysts acquire but the econometrician does not observe. Estimates suggest that analysts structure recommendations strategically to generate a profitable order flow from retail traders. We provide extensive evidence that our model describes how investors believe analysts make recommendations, and that investors value private information revealed by analysts' recommendations."
Fair Value Accounting and Debt Contracting: Evidence from Adoption of SFAS 159,PETER R. DEMERJIAN,17 May 2016,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12126,"ABSTRACTWe examine how fair value accounting affects debt contract design, specifically the use and definition of financial covenants in private loan contracts. Using SFAS 159 adoption as our setting, we find that a small but significant proportion of loans (14.5%) modify covenant definitions to exclude the effects of SFAS 159 fair values. Only a limited number of these modifications exclude assets elected at fair value (less than 7%), while all exclude liabilities elected at fair value. Notably, we document that covenant definition modification is unassociated with ex ante fair value elections. We find that covenant definition modification positively varies with common incentive problems attributed to fair value accounting and negatively varies with benefits attributed to fair value accounting. Our results suggest that fair value accounting is not uniformly detrimental for debt contracting and fair value adjustments are included when they are most likely to improve performance measurement."
The Value of Crowdsourced Earnings Forecasts,RUSSELL JAME,11 April 2016,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12121,"ABSTRACTCrowdsourcing—when a task normally performed by employees is outsourced to a large network of people via an open call—is making inroads into the investment research industry. We shed light on this new phenomenon by examining the value of crowdsourced earnings forecasts. Our sample includes 51,012 forecasts provided by Estimize, an open platform that solicits and reports forecasts from over 3,000 contributors. We find that Estimize forecasts are incrementally useful in forecasting earnings and measuring the market's expectations of earnings. Our results are stronger when the number of Estimize contributors is larger, consistent with the benefits of crowdsourcing increasing with the size of the crowd. Finally, Estimize consensus revisions generate significant two-day size-adjusted returns. The combined evidence suggests that crowdsourced forecasts are a useful supplementary source of information in capital markets."
Do Opinions on Financial Misstatement Firms Affect Analysts’ Reputation with Investors? Evidence from Reputational Spillovers,LIAN FEN LEE,18 March 2016,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12119,"ABSTRACTWe examine whether opinions on firms subsequently revealed to have misstated earnings affect analysts’ reputation with investors. We find that positive opinions by bullish analysts hurt their reputation, leading investors to react less to their research onnon-misstatementfirms after the misstatement revelation (i.e., negative spillovers). We also find that bearish analysts issuing more negative opinions gain reputation and experience positive spillovers. Finally, for analysts who dropped coverage of the misstatement firm before the misstatement revelation, we find no spillovers, which suggests that analysts experience limited reputational gains when they did not issue a public negative opinion."
Performance Measures in Earnings-Based Financial Covenants in Debt Contracts,NINGZHONG LI,12 May 2016,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12125,"ABSTRACTThis paper examines how performance measures are defined in major earnings-based financial covenants in loan contracts to shed light on the economic rationales underlying the contractual use of performance measures. I find an earnings-based covenant is typically based on a performance measure close to earnings before interest, tax, amortization, and depreciation expenses (EBITDA). However, my empirical analyses show that EBITDA is less useful in explaining credit risk than earnings before interest and tax expenses (EBIT) and even the bottom-line net income. Thus, measuring credit risk cannot fully explain the choice of accounting performance measures in earnings-based covenants. I conjecture that contracting parties choose an EBITDA-related measure, instead of a measure calculated after depreciation and amortization expenses (e.g., EBIT), to make the performance measure less sensitive to investment activities, which can be controlled through other contractual terms, such as a restriction on capital expenditure, and provide empirical evidence consistent with this conjecture."

We also review the contemporary textual analysis literature and highlight areas of future research."
Institutional Differences and International Private Debt Markets: A Test Using Mandatory IFRS Adoption,ANNA BERGMAN BROWN,09 February 2016,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12111,"ABSTRACTInstitutional differences between countries result in additional information risks between borrowers and lenders in cross-border private loans. This study examines the effect of these information risks on the structure of optimal debt contracts in international (cross-border) versus domestic private debt markets. Using mandatory IFRS adoption as an indicator for institutional changes that reduced differences between countries, I compare attributes of international versus domestic loans before and after IFRS adoption. I find that, in the pre-IFRS period, international loans are associated with a higher credit spread, a weaker relationship between the bank and the borrower, a more diffuse loan syndicate, and less reliance on accounting-based covenants than domestic loans. These results are consistent with incremental information risks in international debt markets that make it more costly for lenders to screen and monitor borrower credit quality, resulting in a more arm's-length relationship between borrowers and lenders. Many of these associations attenuate after IFRS adoption, suggesting that the pre-IFRS differences in contract terms are driven by incremental information risks related to institutional differences between countries. My findings imply that incremental information risks result in a different optimal contract in international debt contracts compared to domestic debt contracts."
Auditor–Client Compatibility and Audit Firm Selection,STEPHEN V. BROWN,09 January 2016,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12105,"ABSTRACTWe examine auditor switching conditional on the compatibility of clients and their auditors using a unique text-based measure of similarity of financial disclosures. We find clustering of clients within an audit firm based on this measure. We find that clients with the lowest similarity scores are significantly more likely (9.4%–10.6%) to switch auditors, and will change to an audit firm to which they are more similar. Regarding the effect on audit quality, we find that discretionary accruals are lower when similarity is higher. However, accounting restatements are more likely when text disclosures that are unaudited—business description, and management discussion and analysis (MD&A)—are more similar. We find no such similarity effect for the audited footnotes. Finally, we find that firms that are more similar are less likely to receive a going concern opinion (GCO), but the GCO reporting decision is more accurate. It is unclear if this reflects higher or lower audit quality since firms that are candidates for a GCO are intrinsically different from the average firm in an auditor's portfolio due to their financial distress. One implication of these results is that auditors might have greater involvement in the quality of the text disclosures that are currently not audited."
"Bank Competition: Measurement, Decision-Making, and Risk-Taking",ROBERT M. BUSHMAN,15 March 2016,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12117,"ABSTRACTThis paper investigates whether greater competition increases or decreases individual bank and banking system risk. Using a new text-based measure of competition, and an instrumental variables analysis that exploits exogenous variation in bank deregulation, we provide robust evidence that greater competition increases both individual bank risk and a bank's contribution to system-wide risk. Specifically, we find that higher competition is associated with lower underwriting standards, less timely loan loss recognition, and a shift toward noninterest revenue. Further, we find that higher competition is associated with higher stand-alone risk of individual banks, greater sensitivity of a bank's downside equity risk to system-wide distress, and a greater contribution by individual banks to downside risk of the banking sector."
Explaining Rules-Based Characteristics in U.S. GAAP: Theories and Evidence,DAIN C. DONELSON,11 February 2016,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12112,"ABSTRACTDespite debate on the desirability of rules-based standards, no studies provide evidence onwhyaccounting standards take on rules-based characteristics. We identify and test five theories from prior research (litigation risk, constraining opportunism, complexity, transaction frequency, and age) that could explain why some U.S. accounting standards contain rules-based characteristics. Litigation risk and complexity are most consistently related to cross-sectional and time-series variation in rules-based characteristics. We find more limited evidence that frequent transactions, age, and desires by regulators to constrain opportunistic reporting are related to rules-based standards. We note, however, that our findings are necessarily descriptive because standards arise endogenously from market and political forces, limiting causal interpretation. Further, it is difficult to perfectly separate rules-based characteristics of the standard from both the complexity of the standard and the characteristics of the underlying transaction, including the complexity of the transaction."
Lobbying and Uniform Disclosure Regulation,HENRY L. FRIEDMAN,16 March 2016,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12118,"ABSTRACTThis study examines the costs and benefits of uniform accounting regulation in the presence of heterogeneous firms that can lobby the regulator. A commitment to uniform regulation reduces economic distortions caused by lobbying by creating a free-rider problem between lobbying firms at the cost of forcing the same treatment on heterogeneous firms. Resolving this tradeoff, an institutional commitment to uniformity is socially desirable when firms are sufficiently homogeneous or the costs of lobbying to society are large. We show that the regulatory intensity for a given firm can be increasing or decreasing in the degree of uniformity, even though uniformity always reduces lobbying. Our analysis sheds light on the determinants of standard-setting institutions and their effects on corporate governance and lobbying efforts."
Real Activity Forecasts Using Loan Portfolio Information,UROOJ KHAN,05 February 2016,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12110,"ABSTRACTTo extend and monitor loans, banks collect detailed and proprietary information about the financial prospects of their customers, many of whom are local businesses and households. Therefore, banks’ loan portfolios contain potentially useful information about local economic conditions. We investigate the association between information in loan portfolios and local economic conditions. Using a sample of U.S. commercial banks from 1990:Q1 to 2013:Q4, we document that information in loan portfolios aggregated to the state level is associated with current and future changes in statewide economic conditions. Furthermore, the provision for loan and lease losses contains information incremental to leading indicators of state-level economic activity and recessions. Loan portfolio information also helps to improve predictions of economic conditions at more granular levels, such as at the commuting zone level. We discuss the relevance of these findings for economic analysis and forecasting, and the relation of our study to prior work on the informativeness of accounting information about the macroeconomy."
Banks’ Financial Reporting and Financial System Stability,VIRAL V. ACHARYA,15 February 2016,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12114,"ABSTRACTThe use of accounting measures and disclosures in banks’ contracts and regulation suggests that the quality of banks’ financial reporting is central to the efficacy of market discipline and nonmarket mechanisms in limiting banks’ development of debt and risk overhangs in economic good times and in mitigating the adverse consequences of those overhangs for the stability of the financial system in downturns. This essay examines how research on banks’ financial reporting, informed by the financial economics literature on banking, can generate insights about how to enhance the stability of the financial system. We begin with a foundational discussion of how aspects of banks’ accounting and disclosures may affect stability. We then evaluate representative papers in the empirical literature on banks’ financial reporting and stability, pointing out the research design issues that empirical accounting researchers need to confront to develop well-specified tests able to generate reliably interpretable findings. To this end, we provide examples of settings amenable to addressing these issues. We conclude with considerations for accounting standard setters and financial system policy makers."
"Gathering Data for Archival, Field, Survey, and Experimental Accounting Research",ROBERT BLOOMFIELD,28 January 2016,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12104,"ABSTRACTIn the published proceedings of the firstJournal of Accounting ResearchConference, Vatter [1966] lamented that “Gathering direct and original facts is a tedious and difficult task, and it is not surprising that such work is avoided.” For the fiftieth JAR Conference, we introduce a framework to help researchers understand the complementary value of seven empirical methods that gather data in different ways: prestructured archives, unstructured (“hand-collected”) archives, field studies, field experiments, surveys, laboratory studies, and laboratory experiments. The framework spells out five goals of an empirical literature and defines the seven methods according to researchers’ choices with respect to five data gathering tasks. We use the framework and examples of successful research studies in the financial reporting literature to clarify how data gathering choices affect a study's ability to achieve its goals, and conclude by showing how the complementary nature of different methods allows researchers to build a literature more effectively than they could with less diverse approaches to gathering data."
Accounting Information in Financial Contracting: The Incomplete Contract Theory Perspective,HANS B. CHRISTENSEN,27 January 2016,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12108,"ABSTRACTThis paper reviews theoretical and empirical work on financial contracting that is relevant to accounting researchers. Its primary objective is to discuss how the use of accounting information in contracts enhances contracting efficiency and to suggest avenues for future research. We argue that incomplete contract theory broadens our understanding of both the role accounting information plays in contracting and the mechanisms through which efficiency gains are achieved. By discussing its rich theoretical implications, we expect incomplete contract theory to prove useful in motivating future research and in offering directions to advance our knowledge of how accounting information affects contract efficiency."
Using Field Experiments in Accounting and Finance,ERIC FLOYD,13 February 2016,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12113,"ABSTRACTThe gold standard in the sciences is uncovering causal relationships. A growing literature in economics utilizes field experiments as a methodology to establish causality between variables. Taking lessons from the economics literature, this study provides an “A-to-Z” description of how to conduct field experiments in accounting and finance. We begin by providing a user's guide into what a field experiment is, what behavioral parameters field experiments identify, and how to efficiently generate and analyze experimental data. We then provide a discussion of extant field experiments that touch on important issues in accounting and finance, and we also review areas that have ample opportunities for future field experimental explorations. We conclude that the time is ripe for field experimentation to deepen our understanding of important issues in accounting and finance."
Causal Inference in Accounting Research,IAN D. GOW,15 February 2016,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12116,"ABSTRACTThis paper examines the approaches accounting researchers adopt to draw causal inferences using observational (or nonexperimental) data. The vast majority of accounting research papers draw causal inferences notwithstanding the well-known difficulties in doing so. While some recent papers seek to use quasi-experimental methods to improve causal inferences, these methods also make strong assumptions that are not always fully appreciated. We believe that accounting research would benefit from more in-depth descriptive research, including a greater focus on the study of causal mechanisms (or causal pathways) and increased emphasis on the structural modeling of the phenomena of interest. We argue these changes offer a practical path forward for rigorous accounting research."
The Economics of Disclosure and Financial Reporting Regulation: Evidence and Suggestions for Future Research,CHRISTIAN LEUZ,15 February 2016,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12115,"ABSTRACTThis paper discusses the empirical literature on the economic consequences of disclosure and financial reporting regulation, drawing on U.S. and international evidence. Given the policy relevance of research on regulation, we highlight the challenges with (1) quantifying regulatory costs and benefits, (2) measuring disclosure and reporting outcomes, and (3) drawing causal inferences from regulatory studies. Next, we discuss empirical studies that link disclosure and reporting activities to firm-specific and market-wide economic outcomes. Understanding these links is important when evaluating regulation. We then synthesize the empirical evidence on the economic effects of disclosure regulation and reporting standards, including the evidence on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) adoption. Several important conclusions emerge. We generally lack evidence on market-wide effects and externalities from regulation, yet such evidence is central to the economic justification of regulation. Moreover, evidence on causal effects of disclosure and reporting regulation is still relatively rare. We also lack evidence on the real effects of such regulation. These limitations provide many research opportunities. We conclude with several specific suggestions for future research."
A Real Effects Perspective to Accounting Measurement and Disclosure: Implications and Insights for Future Research,CHANDRA KANODIA,27 January 2016,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12109,"ABSTRACTAccounting measurement and disclosure rules have a significant impact on the real decisions that firms make. In this essay, we provide an analytical framework to illustrate how such real effects arise. Using this framework, we examine three specific measurement issues that remain controversial: (1) How does the measurement of investments affect a firm's investment efficiency? (2) How does the measurement and disclosure of a firm's derivative transactions affect a firm's choice of intrinsic risk exposures, risk management strategy, and the incentive to speculate? (3) How could marking-to-market the asset portfolios of financial institutions generate procyclical real effects? We draw upon these real effects studies to generate sharper and novel insights that we believe are useful not only for the development of accounting standards, but also for guiding future empirical research."
Internal Audit Quality and Financial Reporting Quality: The Joint Importance of Independence and Competence,LAWRENCE J. ABBOTT,23 October 2015,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12099,"ABSTRACTIn light of the growing importance of internal audit functions (IAF) and the limited archival evidence on internal audit quality, we examine an interactive model of IAF quality (comprised of competence and independence) to better understand the determinants of IAF effectiveness as a financial reporting monitor. Our tests support the hypothesis that the joint presence of competence and independence is a necessary antecedent to effective IAF financial reporting monitoring. In sum, our results show that, the answer to “what is the effect of internal audit competence (independence) on financial reporting quality?” is “it depends on the independence (competence) of the internal auditor.” Our study extends the understanding of IAF quality determinants in the realm of financial reporting as it relates to ongoing discussions by researchers, standard setters, regulators, and practitioners."
The Changing Landscape of Accrual Accounting,ROBERT M. BUSHMAN,09 November 2015,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12100,"ABSTRACTA fundamental property of accrual accounting is to smooth temporary timing fluctuations in operating cash flows, indicating an inherent negative correlation between accruals and cash flows. We show that the overall correlation between accruals and cash flows has dramatically declined in magnitude over the past half century and has largely disappeared in more recent years. The adjustedR2from regressing (changes in) accruals on (changes in) cash flows drops from about 70% (90%) in the 1960s to near zero (under 20%) in more recent years. In exploring potential reasons for the observed attenuation, we find that increases in non-timing-related accrual recognition, as proxied by one-time and nonoperating items and the frequency of loss firm-years, explain the majority of the overall decline. On the other hand, temporal changes in the matching between revenues and expenses, and the growth of intangible-intensive industries play only a limited role in explaining the observed attenuation. Finally, the relative decline of the timing role of accruals does not appear to be associated with an increase in the asymmetrically timely loss recognition role."
Do Audit Clients Successfully Engage in Opinion Shopping? Partner-Level Evidence,FENG CHEN,22 September 2015,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12097,"ABSTRACTThis study investigates whether companies engage in audit opinion shopping activities by exerting influence over an audit firm's decision to switch the engagement partner (“partner-level opinion shopping”) in the Chinese setting, where the identities of engagement partners are publicly disclosed. Adopting the empirical framework developed by Lennox [2000], we show evidence that companies successfully engage in partner-level opinion shopping. Further, partner-level opinion shopping is more likely to be successful if a company is economically important to an audit firm, and it is less likely to be successful if the audit firm is formed as a partnership rather than a corporation. We also find that companies successfully engaging in partner-level opinion shopping exhibit significantly lower earnings quality. Finally, we directly compare audit records between incoming and outgoing partners and find that, for companies that successfully improve audit opinions after partner switching, incoming partners have a significantly higher propensity to issue clean opinions than their outgoing counterparts."
The Role of Visual Attention in the Managerial Judgment of Balanced-Scorecard Performance Evaluation: Insights from Using an Eye-Tracking Device,YASHENG CHEN,30 November 2015,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12102,"ABSTRACTThis paper investigates the role of visual attention in managerial judgments during balanced-scorecard performance evaluations. Using the Locarna eye tracker to establish the amount of time managers spent focused on visual cues, we found that managers who look more at strategically linked performance measures are more likely to make decisions consistent with the achievement of their subordinates’ strategic objectives. When aware of strategy, managers focused more on strategically linked performance measures than on nonlinked measures. The presentation format of the strategy information did not significantly affect this focus. Our findings indicate that awareness of strategically linked performance measures, but not their presentation, appears to be important in helping managers to make better decisions. This study contributes to the management accounting literature by generating useful insights into the impact of visual attention on judgments and decision-making processes."
Public Pressure and Corporate Tax Behavior,SCOTT D. DYRENG,28 November 2015,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12101,"ABSTRACTWe use a shock to the public scrutiny of firm subsidiary locations to investigate whether that scrutiny leads to changes in firms’ disclosure and corporate tax avoidance behavior. ActionAid International, a nonprofit activist group, levied public pressure on noncompliant U.K. firms in the FTSE 100 to comply with a rule requiring U.K. firms to disclose the location of all of their subsidiaries. We use this setting to examine whether the public pressure led scrutinized firms to increase their subsidiary disclosure, decrease tax avoidance, and reduce the use of subsidiaries in tax haven countries compared to other firms in the FTSE 100 not affected by the public pressure. The evidence suggests that the public scrutiny sufficiently changed the costs and benefits of tax avoidance such that tax expense increased for scrutinized firms. The results suggest that public pressure from outside activist groups can exert a significant influence on the behavior of large, publicly traded firms. Our findings extend prior research that has had little success documenting an empirical relation between public scrutiny of tax avoidance and firm behavior."
The Valuation Impact of SEC Enforcement Actions on Nontarget Foreign Firms,ROGER SILVERS,20 October 2015,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12098,"ABSTRACTThis study shows that the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) enforcement intensity toward the foreign firms under its jurisdiction has increased dramatically over the past two decades. Because enforcement events signify an increased threat of future enforcement, I examine the stock returns of foreign firmsnot targetedby the SEC during windows around enforcement actions that target foreign firms. This design captures the net effects of public enforcement and helps to rule out omitted variables as alternative explanations, because other factors would have to align with enforcement events that do not occur in an obvious pattern (and are therefore unlikely to map onto other news). Nontarget firms experience positive stock returns during the event windows, which is consistent with enforcement constraining the risks of expropriation. The cross-sectional pattern in returns reveals greater returns for firms from weak home legal environments. Finally, consistent with the market adjusting to a new enforcement regime, the magnitude of event returns declines over time. Overall, SEC enforcement is associated with increases in the value of foreign firms, supporting the premise of the legal bonding hypothesis."
Does Fair Value Accounting Exacerbate the Procyclicality of Bank Lending?,BIQIN XIE,01 December 2015,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12103,"ABSTRACTThis study investigates whether fair value accounting contributes to the procyclicality of bank lending. Using banks’ approval/denial decisions on residential mortgage applications to capture banks’ supply of credit, I find no evidence that fair value accounting has procyclical effects on bank lending over the past two business cycles. I further identify two reasons for this result. First, the main accounting item distinguishing fair value accounting from historical cost accounting—unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities—does not affect lending decisions. Second, unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are not procyclical, as the risk-free interest rate rises during some expansionary periods, resulting in unrealized losses, while the risk-free interest rate (and sometimes the default spread) falls during some recessionary periods, resulting in unrealized gains."
Contracting on GAAP Changes: Large Sample Evidence,HANS B. CHRISTENSEN,22 April 2017,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12175,"ABSTRACTWe explore revealed preferences for the contractual treatment of changes to GAAP in a large sample of private credit agreements issued by publicly held U.S. firms. We document a significant time-trend toward excluding GAAP changes from the determination of covenant compliance over the period from 1994 to 2012. This trend is positively associated with proxies for standard setters’ shift in focus toward relevance and international accounting harmonization. At the firm level, borrowers facing higher uncertainty are more likely to write contracts that include GAAP changes, but these firms also show a more pronounced time-trend toward excluding GAAP changes. While this evidence is broadly consistent with an efficiency role for GAAP changes in debt contracting, it is also consistent with a shift in standard setters’ focus offering a partial explanation of why fewer contracts rely on GAAP changes in 2012 than in 1994."
The Performance Effect of Feedback Frequency and Detail: Evidence from a Field Experiment in Customer Satisfaction,PABLO CASAS-ARCE,10 August 2017,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12184,"ABSTRACTThis paper presents the results from a field experiment that examines the effects of nonfinancial performance feedback on the behavior of professionals working for an insurance repair company. We vary the frequency (weekly and monthly) and the level of detail of the feedback that the 800 professionals receive. Contrary to what we would expect if these professionals conformed to the model of the Bayesian decision maker, more (and more frequent) information does not always help improve performance. In fact, we find that professionals achieve the best outcomes when they receive detailed but infrequent (monthly) feedback. The treatment groups with frequent feedback, regardless of how detailed it is, perform no better than the control group (with monthly and aggregate information). The results are consistent with the information in the latest feedback report being most salient and professionals in the weekly treatments overweighting their most recent performance, hampering their ability to learn."
CFO Narcissism and Financial Reporting Quality,CHARLES HAM,25 April 2017,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12176,"ABSTRACTWe investigate the effect of CFO narcissism, as measured by signature size, on financial reporting quality. Experimentally, we validate that narcissism predicts misreporting behavior, and that signature size predicts misreporting through its association with narcissism. Empirically, we examine notarized CFO signatures and find CFO narcissism is associated with more earnings management, less timely loss recognition, weaker internal control quality, and a higher probability of restatements. The results are consistent for within-firm comparisons focusing on CFO changes and are robust to controlling for CFO overconfidence and CEO narcissism. The results highlight the importance of CFO characteristics in the domain of financial reporting decisions."
Improving Experienced Auditors’ Detection of Deception in CEO Narratives,JESSEN L. HOBSON,17 July 2017,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12181,"ABSTRACTWe experimentally study the deception detection capabilities of experienced auditors, using CEO narratives from earnings conference calls as case materials. We randomly assign narratives of fraud and nonfraud companies to auditors as well as the presence versus absence of an instruction explaining that cognitive dissonance in speech is helpful for detecting deception. We predict this instruction will weaken auditors’ learned tendency to overlook fraud cues. We find that auditors’ deception judgments are less accurate for fraud companies than for nonfraud companies, unless they receive this instruction. We also find that instructed auditors more extensively describe red flags for fraud companies and more accurately identify specific sentences in narratives that pertain to underlying frauds. These findings indicate that instructing experienced auditors to be alert for cognitive dissonance in CEO narratives can activate deception detection capabilities."
"Divergence of Cash Flow and Voting Rights, Opacity, and Stock Price Crash Risk: International Evidence",HYUN A. HONG,28 August 2017,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12185,"ABSTRACTThis study investigates whether and how the deviation of cash flow rights (ownership) from voting rights (control), or simply the ownership-control wedge, influences the likelihood that extreme negative outliers occur in stock return distributions, which we refer to as stock price crash risk. We do so using a comprehensive panel data set of firms with a dual-class share structure from 20 countries around the world for the period of 1995–2007. We predict and find that opaque firms with a large wedge are more crash prone than opaque firms with a small wedge. In addition, we predict and find that the positive relation between the wedge and crash risk is less pronounced for firms with more effective external monitoring and for firms with greater growth opportunities. The results of this study are broadly consistent with Jin and Myers’s theory that agency costs, combined with opacity, exacerbate stock price crash risk."
Do Managers of U.S. Defined Benefit Pension Plan Sponsors Use Regulatory Freedom Strategically?,MICHAEL KISSER,29 July 2017,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12182,"ABSTRACTWe use historical particularities of pension funding law to investigate whether managers of U.S. corporate defined benefit pension plan sponsors strategically use regulatory freedom to lower the reported value of pension liabilities, and hence required cash contributions. For some years, pension plans were required to estimate two liabilities—one with mandated discount rates and mortality assumptions, and another where these could be chosen freely. Using a sample of 11,963 plans, we find that the regulated liability exceeds the unregulated measure by 10% and the difference further increases for underfunded pension plans. Underfunded plans tend to assume substantially higher discount rates and lower life expectancy. The effect persists both in the cross-section of plans and over time and it serves to reduce cash contributions. We further show that plan sponsor managers use the freed-up cash for corporate investment and that credit risk is unlikely to explain the finding."
Does Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Create Shareholder Value? Evidence from the Indian Companies Act 2013,HARIOM MANCHIRAJU,17 April 2017,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12174,"ABSTRACTIn 2013, a new law required Indian firms, which satisfy certain profitability, net worth, and size thresholds, to spend at least 2% of their net income on corporate social responsibility (CSR). We exploit this regulatory change to isolate the shareholder value implications of CSR activities. Using an event study approach coupled with a regression discontinuity design, we find that the law, on average, caused a 4.1% drop in the stock price of firms forced to spend money on CSR. However, firms that spend more on advertising are not negatively affected by the mandatory CSR rule. These results suggest that firms voluntarily choose CSR to maximize shareholder value. Therefore, forcing a firm to spend on CSR is likely to be sub-optimal for the firm with a consequent negative impact on shareholder value."
Economic Growth and Financial Statement Verification,PETRO LISOWSKY,02 February 2017,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12165,"ABSTRACTWe use a proprietary data set of financial statements collected by banks to examine whether economic growth is related to the use of financial statement verification in debt financing. Exploiting the distinct economic growth and contraction patterns of the construction industry over the years 2002–2011, our estimates reveal that banks reduced their collection of unqualified audited financial statements from construction firms at nearly twice the rate of firms in other industries during the housing boom period before 2008. This reduction was most severe in the regions that experienced the most significant construction growth. These trends reversed during the subsequent housing crisis in 2008–2011 when construction activity contracted. Moreover, using bank- and firm-level data, we find a strong negative (positive) relation between audited financial statements during the growth period, and subsequent loan losses (construction firm survival) during the contraction period. Collectively, our results reveal that macroeconomic fluctuations produce temporal shifts in the overall level of financial statement verification and temporal shifts in verification are related to bank loan portfolio quality and borrower performance."
The JOBS Act and the Costs of Going Public,SUSAN CHAPLINSKY,20 March 2017,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12172,"ABSTRACTWe examine the effects of Title I of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act for a sample of 312 emerging growth companies (EGCs) that filed for an initial public offering (IPO) from April 5, 2012 through April 30, 2015. We find no reduction in the direct costs of issuance, accounting, legal, or underwriting fees for EGC IPOs. Underpricing, an indirect cost of issuance that increases an issuer's cost of capital, is significantly higher for EGCs compared to other IPOs. More importantly, greater underpricing is present only for larger firms that are newly eligible for scaled disclosure under the Act. Overall, we find little evidence that the Act in its first three years has reduced the measurable costs of going public. Although there are benefits of the Act that issuers appear to value, they should be balanced against the higher costs of capital that can occur after its enactment."
CEO Inside Debt Incentives and Corporate Tax Sheltering,SABRINA CHI,20 February 2017,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12169,"ABSTRACTThis paper examines the relation between CEO inside debt holdings (pension benefits and deferred compensation) and corporate tax sheltering. Because inside debt holdings are generally unsecured and unfunded liabilities of the firm, CEOs are exposed to risk similar to that faced by outside creditors. As such, theory (Jensen and Meckling [1976]) suggests that inside debt holdings negatively impact CEO risk-appetite. To the extent that corporate tax shelters are likely to result in high cash flow volatility in the future, we expect that inside debt holdings will curb CEOs from engaging in tax shelter transactions. Consistent with the prediction, we document a negative association between CEO inside debt holdings and tax sheltering. Additional analyses suggest that the effect of inside debt on tax sheltering is more (less) pronounced in the presence of high default risk and liquidity threats (cash-out options in pension packages). Overall, our results highlight the importance of investigating the implication of CEO debt-like compensation for corporate tax policies."
Enhancing Loan Quality Through Transparency: Evidence from the European Central Bank Loan Level Reporting Initiative,AYTEKIN ERTAN,24 December 2016,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12162,"ABSTRACTWe explore whether transparency in banks’ securitization activities enhances loan quality. We take advantage of a novel disclosure initiative introduced by the European Central Bank, which requires, as of January 2013, banks that use their asset-backed securities as collateral for repo financing to report securitized loan characteristics and performance in a standardized format. We find that securitized loans originated under the transparency regime are of better quality with a lower default probability, a lower delinquent amount, fewer days in delinquency, and lower losses upon default. Additionally, banks with more intensive loan level information collection and those operating under stronger market discipline experience greater improvement in their loan quality under the new reporting standards. Overall, we demonstrate that greater transparency has real effects by incentivizing banks to improve their credit practices."
Imperfect Accounting and Reporting Bias,VIVIAN W. FANG,19 February 2017,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12170,"ABSTRACTErrors and bias are both inherent features of accounting. In theory, while errors discourage bias by lowering the value relevance of accounting, they can also facilitate bias by providing camouflage. Consistent with theory, we find a hump-shaped relation between a firm's propensity to engage in intentional misstatement and the prevalence of unintentional misstatements in the firm's industry for the whole economy and a majority of the industries. The result is robust to using firms’ number of items in financial statements and exposure to complex accounting rules as alternative proxies for errors and to using the restatement amount in net income to quantify the magnitude of bias and errors. To directly test for the two effects of errors, we show that when errors are more prevalent, the market reacts less to firms’ earnings surprises and bias is more difficult to detect. Our results highlight the imperfectness of accounting, advance understanding of firms’ reporting incentives, and shed light on accounting standard setting."
Prompting the Benefit of the Doubt: The Joint Effect of Auditor-Client Social Bonds and Measurement Uncertainty on Audit Adjustments,STEVEN J. KACHELMEIER,18 March 2017,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12171,"ABSTRACTWe design an incentivized experiment to test whether measurement uncertainty elevates the risk that social bonds between auditors and reporters compromise audit adjustments. Results indicate that, when audit evidence is characterized by some residual uncertainty, the adjustments our auditor-participants require are sensitive to whether auditors have an opportunity to form a modest but friendly social bond with reporters. In contrast, although auditors do not adjust fully even when misstatements are known with certainty, social bonding has no effect in this scenario. Accordingly, our experiment contributes beyond the main effects of social bonding and measurement uncertainty demonstrated in prior research by showing that these forces interact. A practical implication is that regulators and practitioners should consider both the technical and the social challenges facing audits of complex estimates."
Supporting and Assessing Agents,VOLKER LAUX,28 March 2017,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12173,"ABSTRACTThis manuscript proposes a theory of why and when organizations “support” their employees with resources, time, and freedom beyond what seems economically optimal. The idea is that support plays an information-generating role in that it renders output more informative about employees' abilities. This effect reduces the need to gather additional information about ability via costly monitoring and commits the firm to make replacement/promotion decisions that are more sensitive to performance. Consequently, support indirectly strengthens employees' career concern incentives and reduces the pressure on costly bonus payments. I apply the model to tech companies, academia, and capital budgeting."
Do Weather-Induced Moods Affect the Processing of Earnings News?,ED DEHAAN,22 December 2016,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12160,"ABSTRACTWe investigate whether unpleasant environmental conditions affect stock market participants’ responses to information events. We draw from psychology research to develop a new prediction that weather-induced negative moods reduce market participants’ activity levels. Exploiting geographic variation in equity analysts’ locations, we find compelling evidence that analysts experiencing unpleasant weather are slower or less likely to respond to an earnings announcement relative to analysts responding to the same announcement but experiencing pleasant weather. Price association tests find evidence consistent with reduced activity due to weather-induced moods delaying equilibrium price adjustments following earnings announcements. We also use our analyst-based research design to re-examine an existing prediction that unpleasant weather induces investor pessimism, and find evidence of both analyst pessimism and reduced activity in the presence of unpleasant weather. Together, our study provides new evidence that both extends and reaffirms findings of a relation between unpleasant weather and market activities, and contributes to the broader psychology and economics literature on the impact of weather-induced mood on labor productivity."
Under weighting of Private Information by Top Analysts,GIL AHARONI,12 September 2016,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12152,"ABSTRACTIt is conventionally perceived in the literature that weak analysts are likely to under weight their private information and strategically bias their announcements in the direction of the public beliefs to avoid scenarios where their private information turns out to be wrong, whereas strong analysts tend to adopt an opposite strategy of over weighting their private information and shifting their announcements away from the public beliefs in an attempt to stand out from the crowd. Analyzing a reporting game between two financial analysts, who are compensated based on their relative forecast accuracy, we demonstrate that it could be the other way around. An investigation of the equilibrium in our game suggests that, contrary to the common perception, analysts who benefit from information advantage may strategically choose to understate their exclusive private information and bias their announcements toward the public beliefs, while exhibiting the opposite behavior of overstating their private information when they estimate that their peers are likely to be equally informed."
Do PCAOB Inspections Improve the Quality of Internal Control Audits?,MARK L. DEFOND,12 September 2016,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12151,"ABSTRACTWe investigate whether Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) inspections affect the quality of internal control audits. Our research design improves on prior studies by exploiting both cross-sectional and time-series variation in the content of PCAOB inspection reports, while also controlling for audit firm and year fixed effects, effectively achieving a difference-in-differences research design. We find that when PCAOB inspectors report higher rates of deficiencies in internal control audits, auditors respond by increasing the issuance of adverse internal control opinions. We also find that auditors issue more adverse internal control opinions to clients with concurrent misstatements, who thus genuinely warrant adverse opinions. We further find that higher inspection deficiency rates lead to higher audit fees, consistent with PCAOB inspections prompting auditors to undertake costly remediation efforts. Taken together, our results are consistent with the PCAOB inspections improving the quality of internal control audits by prompting auditors to remediate deficiencies in their audits of internal controls."
Does Social Capital Matter in Corporate Decisions? Evidence from Corporate Tax Avoidance,IFTEKHAR HASAN,09 December 2016,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12159,"ABSTRACTWe investigate whether the levels of social capital in U.S. counties, as captured by strength of civic norms and density of social networks in the counties, are systematically related to tax avoidance activities of corporations with headquarters located in the counties. We find strong negative associations between social capital and corporate tax avoidance, as captured by effective tax rates and book-tax differences. These results are incremental to the effects of local religiosity and firm culture toward socially irresponsible activities. They are robust to using organ donation as an alternative social capital proxy and fixed effect regressions. They extend to aggressive tax avoidance practices. Additionally, we provide corroborating evidence using firms with headquarters relocation that changes the exposure to social capital. We conclude that social capital surrounding corporate headquarters provides environmental influences constraining corporate tax avoidance."
Sharing Risk with the Government: How Taxes Affect Corporate Risk Taking,ALEXANDER LJUNGQVIST,01 November 2016,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12157,"ABSTRACTUsing 113 staggered changes in corporate income tax rates across U.S. states, we provide evidence on how taxes affect corporate risk-taking decisions. Higher taxes reduce expected profits more for risky projects than for safe ones, as the government shares in a firm's upside but not in its downside. Consistent with this prediction, we find that risk taking is sensitive to taxes, albeit asymmetrically: the average firm reduces risk in response to a tax increase (primarily by changing its operating cycle and reducing R&D risk) but does not respond to a tax cut. We trace the asymmetry back to constraints on risk taking imposed by creditors. Finally, tax loss-offset rules moderate firms’ sensitivity to taxes by allowing firms to partly share downside risk with the government."
Anticipated Earnings Announcements and the Customer–Supplier Anomaly,JOSHUA MADSEN,25 November 2016,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12158,"ABSTRACTI test whether the anticipation of earnings news stimulates acquisition of customer information and mitigates returns to the customer–supplier anomaly documented by Cohen and Frazzini (“Economic Links and Predictable Returns.”The Journal of Finance63 (2008): 1977–2011). I find that attention to a firm's publicly disclosed customers increases shortly before the firm announces earnings, and that customer stock returns predict supplier stock returns shortly before, but not after, the supplier's earnings announcement. I further find some evidence that these predictable returns are increasing in the level of customer information acquisition. These results are unique to anticipated disclosure events and suggest that anticipation of supplier earnings announcements resolves investor limited attention to customer information and accelerates price discovery of customer news."
Procyclicality of U.S. Bank Leverage,CHRISTIAN LAUX,23 December 2016,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12163,"ABSTRACTIn light of the current debate about the link between accounting and financial stability, we investigate the determinants of procyclical book leverage for U.S. commercial and savings banks. We find that total asset growth and GDP growth are both positively related to book leverage growth. Our evidence is not consistent with the notion that fair value accounting contributes to procyclical leverage or that historical cost accounting reduces procyclicality. Overall, the business model of banks is more important for procyclical leverage than accounting or regulatory risk weights."
Perceptions and Price: Evidence from CEO Presentations at IPO Roadshows,ELIZABETH BLANKESPOOR,23 January 2017,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12164,"ABSTRACTThis paper examines the relation between cognitive perceptions of management and firm valuation. We develop a composite measure of investor perception using 30-second content-filtered video clips of initial public offering (IPO) roadshow presentations. We show that this measure, designed to capture viewers’ overall perceptions of a CEO, is positively associated with pricing at all stages of the IPO (proposed price, offer price, and end of first day of trading). The result is robust to controls for traditional determinants of firm value. We also show that firms with highly perceived management are more likely to be matched to high-quality underwriters. In further exploratory analyses, we find the impact is greater for firms with more uncertain language in their written S-1. Taken together, our results provide evidence that investors’ instinctive perceptions of management are incorporated into their assessments of firm value."
Dynamic Effects of Information Disclosure on Investment Efficiency,SUNIL DUTTA,24 December 2016,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12161,"ABSTRACTThis paper studies how information disclosure affects investment efficiency and investor welfare in a dynamic setting in which a firm makes sequential investments to adjust its capital stock over time. We show that the effects of accounting disclosures on investment efficiency and investor welfare crucially depend on whether such disclosures convey information about the firm's future capital stock (i.e., balance sheet) or about its future operating cash flows (i.e., earnings). Specifically, investment efficiency and investor welfare unambiguously increase in the precision of disclosures that convey information about the future capital stock, since such disclosures mitigate the current owners' incentives to underinvest. In contrast, when accounting reports provide information about future cash flows, the firm can have incentives to either under- or overinvest depending on the precision of accounting reports and the expected growth in demand. For such disclosures, investment efficiency and investor welfare are maximized by an intermediate level of precision. The two types of accounting disclosures act as substitutes in that the precision of capital stock disclosures that maximizes investment efficiency (and investor welfare) decreases as cash flow disclosures become more informative and vice versa."
Direct Evidence on the Informational Properties of Earnings in Loan Contracts,SCOTT D. DYRENG,28 February 2017,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12168,"ABSTRACTUsing a sample of firms that disclose the realizations of earnings used for determining covenant compliance in loan contracts, we provide direct evidence on the informational properties of earnings used in the performance covenants included in debt contracts. We find that the earnings measure used in performance covenants does not exhibit asymmetric loss timeliness and has significantly greater cash flow predictive ability than GAAP measures of earnings. We suggest that these results reflect the idea that contracting parties design accounting rules for performance covenants to enhance their efficacy as “tripwires.”"
Earnings Management During Antidumping Investigations in Europe: Sample-Wide and Cross-Sectional Evidence,DAVID GODSELL,08 February 2017,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12166,"ABSTRACTThis paper examines earnings management by EU firms that initiate an antidumping investigation. We first document economically and statistically significant income-decreasing earnings management around the initiation of an antidumping investigation. We show that earnings management increases when accounting data directly affect the magnitude of the tariffs imposed in the trade investigation. We also find that earnings management decreases as the number of petitioning firms increases or as the distance between petitioning firms increases, suggesting free-rider and coordination problems. We find that earnings management increases when the petition is directed at a country that imports more goods from the petitioning firm's home country, suggesting that retaliation threats affect incentives. We document that raising equity or debt financing moderates income-decreasing earnings management, consistent with the idea that sample firms trade off capital market and regulatory considerations. Our results indicate that contemporary research methods can detect accruals-based earnings management in settings in which the incentives for earnings management can be clearly identified."
Run EDGAR Run: SEC Dissemination in a High-Frequency World,JONATHAN L. ROGERS,03 March 2017,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12167,"ABSTRACTWe describe the process through which the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) makes filings “publicly available.” For a sample of Form 4 (insider trade) filings, we show that, during the period we examine, the majority of filings are available to paying subscribers of the SEC's public dissemination system (PDS) feed before they are posted to the EDGAR website, and so provide subscribers and their clients with a private advantage. We show that this advantage translates into an economically significant trading advantage, and prices, volumes, and spreads respond to the news contained in filings beginning around 30 seconds before public posting. These findings indicate that the SEC dissemination process does not always provide a level playing field and that the meaning of publicly available information in capital markets is no longer simple or obvious. In response to our study, the SEC launched an investigation and agreed to eliminate the PDS timing advantage."
Disclosure Versus Recognition: Inferences from Subsequent Events,JEREMY MICHELS,09 June 2016,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12128,"ABSTRACTStandard setters explicitly state that disclosure should not substitute for recognition in financial reports. Consistent with this directive, prior research shows that investors find recognized values more pertinent than disclosed values. However, it remains unclear whether reporting items are recognized because they are more relevant for investing decisions, or whether requiring recognition itself prompts differing behavior on the part of firms and investors. Using the setting of subsequent events, I identify the differential effect of requiring disclosure versus recognition in a setting where the accounting treatment of an item is exogenously determined. For comparable events, I find a stronger initial market response for firms required to recognize relative to firms that must disclose, although the large magnitude of the identified effect calls into question whether this difference can be attributed to accounting treatments alone. In examining various reasons for the stronger market response to recognized values, I fail to find support for the hypothesis that this difference is due to differential reliability of disclosed and recognized values. I do find some evidence that investors underreact to disclosed events, consistent with investors incurring higher processing costs when using disclosed information."
The Effect of Regulatory Harmonization on Cross-Border Labor Migration: Evidence from the Accounting Profession,MATTHEW J. BLOOMFIELD,28 October 2016,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12155,"ABSTRACTThe paper examines whether international regulatory harmonization increases cross-border labor migration. To study this question, we analyze European Union initiatives that harmonized accounting and auditing standards. Regulatory harmonization should reduce economic mobility barriers, essentially making it easier for accounting professionals to move across countries. Our research design compares the cross-border migration of accounting professionals relative to tightly matched other professionals before and after regulatory harmonization. We find that international labor migration in the accounting profession increases significantly relative to other professions. We provide evidence that this effect is due to harmonization, rather than increases in the demand for accounting services during the implementation of the rule changes. The findings illustrate that diversity in rules constitutes an economic barrier to cross-border labor mobility and, more specifically, that accounting harmonization can have a meaningful effect on cross-border migration."
IRS Attention,ZAHN BOZANIC,30 September 2016,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12154,"ABSTRACTWe study how public and private disclosure requirements interact to influence both tax regulator enforcement and firm disclosure. To capture IRS enforcement activities, we introduce a novel data set of IRS acquisition of firms’ public financial disclosures, which we label IRS attention. We examine the implementation of two new disclosure requirements that potentially alter IRS attention: FIN 48, which increasedpublictax disclosure requirements, and Schedule UTP, which increasedprivatetax disclosure. We find that IRS attention increased following FIN 48 but subsequently decreased following Schedule UTP, consistent with public and private disclosure interacting to influence tax enforcement. We next examine how private tax disclosure requirements under Schedule UTP affected firms’ public disclosure responses. We find that, following Schedule UTP, firms significantly increased the quantity and altered the content of their tax-related disclosures, consistent with lower tax-related proprietary costs of disclosure. Our results suggest that changes in SEC disclosure requirements altered the IRS's behavior with regard to public information acquisition, and, relatedly, changes in IRS private disclosure requirements appear to change firms’ public disclosure behavior."
The Informational Role of the Media in Private Lending,ROBERT M. BUSHMAN,24 June 2016,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12131,"ABSTRACTWe investigate whether a borrower's media coverage influences the syndicated loan origination and participation decisions of informationally disadvantaged lenders, loan syndicate structures, and interest spreads. In syndicated loan deals, information asymmetries can exist between lenders that have a relationship with a borrower and less informed, nonrelationship lenders competing to serve as lead arranger on a syndicated loan, and also between lead arrangers and less informed syndicate participants. Theory suggests that the aggressiveness with which less informed lenders compete for a loan deal increases in the sentiment of public information signals about a borrower. We extend this theory to syndicated loans and hypothesize that the likelihood of less informed lenders serving as the lead arranger or joining a loan syndicate is increasing in the sentiment of media-initiated, borrower-specific articles published prior to loan origination. We find that as media sentiment increases (1) outside, nonrelationship lenders have a higher probability of originating loans; (2) syndicate participants are less likely to have a previous relationship with the borrower or lead bank; (3) lead banks retain a lower percentage of loans; and (4) loan spreads decrease."
Uniform Versus Discretionary Regimes in Reporting Information with Unverifiable Precision and a Coordination Role,QI CHEN,25 June 2016,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12130,"ABSTRACTWe examine uniform and discretionary regimes for reporting information about firm performance from the perspective of a standard setter, in a setting where the precision of reported information is difficult to verify and the reported information can help coordinate decisions by users of the information. The standard setter's task is to choose a reporting regime to maximize the expected decision value of reported information for all users at all firms. The uniform regime requires all firms to report using the same set of reporting methods regardless of the precision of their information, and the discretionary regime allows firms to freely condition their sets of reporting methods on the precision of their information. We show that when unverifiable information precision varies across firms and users' decisions based on reported information have strong strategic complementarities, a uniform regime can have a beneficial social effect as compared to a discretionary reporting regime. Our analysis generates both normative and positive implications for evaluating the necessity and effectiveness of reporting under standards."
Financial Statements as Monitoring Mechanisms: Evidence from Small Commercial Loans,MICHAEL MINNIS,14 July 2016,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12127,"ABSTRACTUsing a data set that records banks’ ongoing requests of information from small commercial borrowers, we examine when banks use financial statements to monitor borrowersafter loan origination. We find that banks request financial statements for half the loans and this variation is related to borrower credit risk, relationship length, collateral, and the provision of business tax returns, but in complex ways. The relation between borrower risk and financial statement requests has an inverted U-shape; and tax returns can be both substitutes and complements to financial statements, conditional on borrower characteristics and the degree of bank–borrower information asymmetry. Frequent financial reporting is used to monitor collateral, but only for non–real estate loans and only when the collateral is easily accessible to lenders. Collectively, our results provide novel evidence of a fundamental information demand for financial reporting in monitoring small commercial borrowers and a specific channel through which banks fulfill their role as delegated monitors."
Managerial Compensation and Stock Price Manipulation,JOSEF SCHROTH,06 July 2018,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12237,"ABSTRACTThis paper studies the role of optimal managerial compensation in reducing uncertainty about manager reporting objectives. It is shown that, paradoxically, firm owners allow managers with higher propensity to manipulate the short-term stock price to push for higher powered and more short-term-focused equity incentives. Such managers also work harder, and manipulate more, but may not generate higher firm profits. The model is consistent with existing empirical findings about the relationship between manipulation and equity pay, suggesting that heterogeneity in manager manipulation propensities may be an important driver of heterogeneity in pay. Novel testable predictions are developed."
Debt Contract Enforcement and Conservatism: Evidence from a Natural Experiment,CYRUS AGHAMOLLA,18 July 2018,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12238,"ABSTRACTThis study provides evidence that the use of conservative accounting in debt contracting depends on the enforceability of the contract. To test the effect of debt contract enforcement on borrowers' timely loss recognition, we exploit the staggered introduction of enhanced debt contract enforcement in Indian states as a natural experiment, where the implementation of the enforcement is exogenous to the accounting choices and borrowing behavior of firms. The main results show that enhanced enforcement has a significant positive effect on the timeliness of loss recognition of borrowing firms. We find that the effect is strongest for firms that increased their overall borrowing and for firms with high levels of tangible assets, consistent with a collateral-based explanation. This study also provides causal evidence that firms adopt conservative accounting due to lenders' demand."
Procurement with Asymmetric Information About Fixed and Variable Costs,RICK ANTLE,29 June 2018,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12236,"ABSTRACTWe investigate optimal rationing of resources and organizational slack when a principal procures from an agent with private information about fixed and variable costs. We study the problem in a two-period setting with persistent types and investigate how the optimal rationing and slack depend on whether production increases or decreases over time. We find that rationing in a dynamic model with persistent types is extra costly, since the types that are eliminated in period 1 might have been attractive in period 2. The cost of rationing increases with the variability of production. If production levels are increasing (decreasing), the principal will be cautious when eliminating types with low variable (fixed) costs in period 1, since these types are particularly profitable in period 2. When production is more stable over time, harsher rationing can be applied in period 1, followed by less harsh rationing, if any, in period 2."
Prepopulating Audit Workpapers with Prior Year Assessments: Default Option Effects on Risk Rating Accuracy,SARAH BONNER,21 May 2018,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12218,"ABSTRACTRisk assessment is a critical audit task, as auditors’ accuracy therein affects audit effectiveness and financial reporting quality, as well as audit efficiency. We propose that risk assessment accuracy for client risks that have changed from the prior year is affected by themannerin which auditors access prior year risk assessments, specifically whether they face a default option created by the prepopulation of current year workpapers with those assessments. We find that auditors with prepopulated (vs. blank) workpapers are less accurate for risks that have changed because they are more likely to stick with last year's assessments, and also to work fast. We then show that auditor characteristics reflecting a preference for accuracy reduce, but do not eliminate, these effects. Finally, we provide exploratory evidence that sticking and working fast are associated with, respectively, motivated reasoning and superficial processing. Collectively, these findings suggest the critical need for an intervention, and also have implications outside auditing."
Negative News and Investor Trust: The Role of $Firm and #CEO Twitter Use,W. BROOKE ELLIOTT,02 May 2018,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12217,"ABSTRACTWe examine how CEOs can facilitate the development of investor trust that helps mitigate the effects of negative information. Results from an experiment show that investors trust the CEO more and are more willing to invest in the firm when the CEO communicates firm news followed by a negative earnings surprise through a personal Twitter account than when the news and surprise comes from the CEO via a website or from the firm's Investor Relations Twitter account or website. A follow-up experiment shows that repeating the negative news does not incrementally affect investors who received the news from the CEO's Twitter account, but does further negatively impact investors who received the news via other disclosure mediums, especially those who received the news via the Investor Relations Twitter account. Our results have implications for firms and executives considering the costs and benefits of communicating with investors via Twitter."
Disentangling Managers’ and Analysts’ Non-GAAP Reporting,JEREMIAH W. BENTLEY,09 February 2018,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12206,"ABSTRACTResearchers frequently proxy for managers’ non-GAAP disclosures using performance metrics available through analyst forecast data providers (FDPs), such as I/B/E/S. The extent to which FDP-provided earnings are a valid proxy for managers’ non-GAAP reporting, however, has been debated extensively. We explore this important question by creating the first large-sample data set of managers’ non-GAAP earnings disclosures, which we directly compare to I/B/E/S data. Although we find a substantial overlap between the two data sets, we also find that they differ in systematic ways because I/B/E/S (1) excludes managers’ lower quality non-GAAP numbers and (2) sometimes provides higher quality non-GAAP measures that managers do not explicitly disclose. Our results indicate that using I/B/E/S to identify managers’ non-GAAP disclosures significantly underestimates the aggressiveness of their reporting choices. We encourage researchers interested in managers’ non-GAAP reporting to use our newly available data set of manager-disclosed non-GAAP metrics because it more accurately captures managers’ reporting choices."
Non-GAAP Earnings Disclosure in Loss Firms,EDITH LEUNG,28 April 2018,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12216,"ABSTRACTThis study examines the incremental information in loss firms’ non-GAAP earnings disclosures relative to GAAP earnings. Using a large sample obtained through textual analysis and hand-collection, we posit and find that loss firms’ non-GAAP earnings exclusions offset the low informativeness of GAAP losses for forecasting and valuation. Loss firms’ non-GAAP earnings are highly predictive of future performance and are valued by investors, while the expenses excluded from GAAP earnings are not. Additional tests suggest that loss firms disclosing non-GAAP profits have significantly better future performance than GAAP-only loss firms and are not overvalued by investors. Comparing non-GAAP earnings of profitable firms to those of loss firms, we find that loss firms’ non-GAAP metrics are significantly more predictive and less strategic. We conclude that non-GAAP earnings disclosures are particularly informative about loss firms and help investors disaggregate losses into components that have differential implications for forecasting and valuation."
Inference with Dependent Data in Accounting and Finance Applications,TIMOTHY CONLEY,12 June 2018,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12219,"ABSTRACTWe review developments in conducting inference for model parameters in the presence of intertemporal and cross-sectional dependence with an emphasis on panel data applications. We review the use of heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent (HAC) standard error estimators, which include the standard clustered and multiway clustered estimators, and discuss alternative sample-splitting inference procedures, such as the Fama–Macbeth procedure, within this context. We outline pros and cons of the different procedures. We then illustrate the properties of the discussed procedures within a simulation experiment designed to mimic the type of firm-level panel data that might be encountered in accounting and finance applications. Our conclusion, based on theoretical properties and simulation performance, is that sample-splitting procedures with suitably chosen splits are the most likely to deliver robust inferential statements with approximately correct coverage properties in the types of large, heterogeneous panels many researchers are likely to face."
The Role of Tacit Knowledge in Auditor Expertise and Human Capital Development,JASMIJN C. BOL,19 June 2018,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12220,"ABSTRACTTwo critical aspects of the model of auditor expertise development in Tan and Libby [1997] are that audit firms donotvalue tacit knowledge in inexperienced auditors butdovalue it in experienced auditors. We update the former and extend the latter. Our paper predicts and finds that audit firms nowdovalue tacit knowledge in inexperienced auditors, especially when their supervisors have higher tacit knowledge. Our proxies of value include higher promotability assessments, annual evaluations, and cash bonuses. Our paper also extends Tan and Libby [1997] by positing that enhanced development of expertise and audit firm human capital are two reasons audit firms value tacit knowledge in experienced auditors. As predicted, higher tacit knowledge in experienced auditors is positively associated with higher tacit knowledge acquisition by their inexperienced subordinates and with stronger firm commitment of inexperienced subordinates having higher tacit knowledge."
Mandatory and Voluntary Disclosures: Dynamic Interactions,DAVIDE CIANCIARUSO,16 April 2018,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12210,"ABSTRACTFirms sometimes obtain soft private information about growth prospects along with hard information about current or past performance. In this environment, we find that optimizing disclosures over multiple periods yields nonlinear stock price reactions following both voluntary and mandatory disclosures. Further, we derive several predictions about distinct short-run and long-run effects of disclosures and nondisclosures on security prices. Under specified conditions, when the volatility of the firm's earnings increases, the average contemporaneous and prospective post-mandatory-disclosure market premia (for voluntary disclosures over nondisclosures) rise, while farther-in-future market discounts (for such voluntary disclosures) also become larger. Our analysis moreover predicts that both the disclosure probability and the information content of nondisclosures can increase in the persistence of earnings."
Zombie Board: Board Tenure and Firm Performance,STERLING HUANG,26 March 2018,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12209,"ABSTRACTWe show that board tenure exhibits an inverted U-shaped relation with firm value and accounting performance. The quality of corporate decisions, such as M&A, financial reporting quality, and CEO compensation, also has a quadratic relation with board tenure. Our results are consistent with the interpretation that directors’ on-the-job learning improves firm value up to a threshold, at which point entrenchment dominates and firm performance suffers. To address endogeneity concerns, we use a sample of firms in which an outside director suffered a sudden death, and find that sudden deaths that move board tenure away from (toward) the empirically observed optimum level in the cross-section are associated with negative (positive) announcement returns. The quality of corporate decisions also follows an inverted U-shaped pattern in a sample of firms affected by the death of a director."
Incorrect Inferences When Using Residuals as Dependent Variables,WEI CHEN,22 February 2018,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12195,"ABSTRACTWe analyze a procedure common in empirical accounting and finance research where researchers use ordinary least squares to decompose a dependent variable into its predicted and residual components and use the residuals as the dependent variable in a second regression. This two-step procedure is used to examine determinants of constructs such as discretionary accruals, real activities management, discretionary book-tax differences, and abnormal investment. We show that the typical implementation of this procedure generates biased coefficients and standard errors that can lead to incorrect inferences, with both Type I and Type II errors. We further show that the magnitude of the bias in coefficients and standard errors is a function of the correlations between model regressors. We illustrate the potential magnitude of the bias in accounting research in four commonly used settings. Our results indicate significant bias in many of these settings. We offer three solutions to avoid the bias."
Shareholder Litigation and Corporate Disclosure: Evidence from Derivative Lawsuits,THOMAS BOURVEAU,13 November 2017,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12191,"ABSTRACTUsing the staggered adoption of universal demand (UD) laws in the United States, we study the effect of shareholder litigation risk on corporate disclosure. We find that disclosure significantly increases after UD laws make it more difficult to file derivative lawsuits. Specifically, firms issue more earnings forecasts and voluntary 8-K filings, and increase the length of management discussion and analysis (MD&A) in their 10-K filings. We further assess the direct and indirect channels through which UD laws affect firms' disclosure policies. We find that the effect of UD laws on corporate disclosure is driven by firms facing relatively higher ex ante derivative litigation risk and higher operating uncertainty, as well as firms for which shareholder litigation is a more important mechanism to discipline managers."
The Real Effects of FAS 166/167 on Banks’ Mortgage Approval and Sale Decisions,YIWEI DOU,22 February 2018,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12204,"ABSTRACTWe examine the real effects of FAS 166 and FAS 167 on banks’ loan-level mortgage approval and sale decisions. Effective in 2010, these standards tightened the accounting for securitizations and consolidation of securitization entities, respectively, causing banks to recognize an estimated $811 billion of securitized assets on balance sheet. We find that banks that recognize more securitized assets exhibit larger decreases in mortgage approval rates and larger increases in mortgage sale rates. These effects significantly exceed those of banks’ off–balance sheet securitized assets, consistent with our results being driven by the consolidation of securitization entities rather than by securitization per se. We conduct tests that help rule out the financial crisis as an alternative explanation for our results. Further analyses suggest that mechanisms underlying the results include consolidating banks’ reduced regulatory capital adequacy, increased market discipline, and consequent desire not to recognize high-risk mortgages on balance sheet."
Cross-Firm Real Earnings Management,ETI EINHORN,25 October 2017,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12188,"ABSTRACTOur analysis is rooted in the notion that stockholders can learn about the fundamental value of any firm from observing the earnings reports of its rivals. We argue that such intraindustry information transfers, which have been broadly documented in the empirical literature, may motivate managers to alter stockholders’ beliefs about the value of their firm not only by manipulating their own earnings report but also by influencing the earnings reports of rival firms. Managers obviously do not have access to the accounting system of peer firms, but they can nevertheless influence the earnings reports of rival firms by distorting real transactions that relate to the product market competition. We demonstrate such managerial behavior, which we refer to as cross-firm real earnings management, and explore its potential consequences and interrelation with the practice of accounting-based earnings management within an industry setting with imperfect (nonproprietary) accounting information."
Buy-Side Analysts and Earnings Conference Calls,MICHAEL J. JUNG,20 July 2017,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12180,"ABSTRACTCompanies’ earnings conference calls are perceived to be venues for sell-side equity analysts to ask management questions. In this study, we examine another important conference call participant—the buy-side analyst—that has been underexplored in the literature due to data limitations. Using a large sample of transcripts, we identify 3,834 buy-side analysts from 701 institutional investment firms who participated (i.e., asked a question) in 13,332 conference calls to examine the determinants and implications of their participation. Buy-side analysts are more likely to participate when sell-side analyst coverage is low and dispersion in sell-side earnings forecasts is high, consistent with buy-side analysts participating when a company's information environment is poor. Institutional investors trade more of a company's stock in the quarters in which their buy-side analysts participate in the call. Finally, we find evidence that buy-side analyst participation is associated with company-level absolute changes in future stock price, trading volume, institutional ownership, and short interest."
Credit Default Swaps and Managers’ Voluntary Disclosure,JAE B. KIM,26 December 2017,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12194,"ABSTRACTWe investigate how the availability of traded credit default swaps (CDSs) affects the referenced firms’ voluntary disclosure choices. CDSs enable lenders to hedge their credit risk exposure, weakening their incentives to monitor borrowers. We predict that reduced lender monitoring in turn leads shareholders to intensify their monitoring and demand increased voluntary disclosure from managers. Consistent with this expectation, we find that managers are more likely to issue earnings forecasts and forecast more frequently when traded CDSs reference their firms. We further find a stronger impact of CDS availability on firm disclosure when (1) lenders have higher ability and propensity to hedge credit risk using CDSs, and (2) lender monitoring incentives and monitoring strength are weaker. Consistent with an increase in shareholder demand for public information disclosure induced by a reduction in lender monitoring, we find a stronger effect of CDSs on voluntary disclosure for firms with higher institutional ownership and stronger corporate governance. Overall, our findings suggest that firms with traded CDS contracts enhance their voluntary disclosure to offset the effect of reduced monitoring by CDS-protected lenders."
Wisdom of Crowds: Cross-Sectional Variation in the Informativeness of Third-Party-Generated Product Information on Twitter,VICKI WEI TANG,10 August 2017,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12183,"ABSTRACTThis paper examines whether third-party-generated product information on Twitter, once aggregated at the firm level, is predictive of firm-level sales, and if so, what factors determine the cross-sectional variation in the predictive power. First, the predictive power of Twitter comments increases with the extent to which they fairly represent the broad customer response to products and brands. The predictive power is greater for firms whose major customers are consumers rather than businesses. Second, the word-of-mouth effect of Twitter comments is greater when advertising is limited. Third, a detailed analysis of the identity of the tweet handles provides the additional insights that the predictive power of the volume of Twitter comments is dominated by “the wisdom of crowds,” whereas the predictive power of the valence of Twitter comments is largely attributable to expert comments. Furthermore, Twitter comments not only reflect upcoming sales, but also capture an unexpected component of sales growth."
No System Is Perfect: Understanding How Registration-Based Editorial Processes Affect Reproducibility and Investment in Research Quality,ROBERT BLOOMFIELD,05 March 2018,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12208,"ABSTRACTThe papers in this volume were published through a Registration-based Editorial Process (REP). Authors submitted proposals to gather and analyze data; successful proposals were guaranteed publication as long as the authors lived up to their commitments, regardless of whether results supported their predictions. To understand how REP differs from the Traditional Editorial Process (TEP), we analyze the papers themselves; conference comments; a survey of conference authors, reviewers, and attendees; and a survey of authors who have successfully published under TEP. We find that REP increases up-front investment in planning, data gathering, and analysis, but reduces follow-up investment after results are known. This shift in investment makes individual results more reproducible, but leaves articles less thorough and refined. REP could be improved by encouraging selected forms of follow-up investment that survey respondents believe are usually used under TEP to make papers more informative, focused, and accurate at little risk of overstatement."
Disclosure “Scriptability”,KRISTIAN D. ALLEE,07 February 2018,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12203,"ABSTRACTIn response to the increasing use of computer programs to process firm disclosures, this registered report develops a new measure of “scriptability” that reflects computerized, rather than human, information processing costs. We validate our measure using SEC filing-derived data from prior research and identify firm and disclosure characteristics related to it. In our planned hypothesis tests, we find some evidence that the speed of the market response to filings increases with scriptability, but find little evidence that scriptability affects the incidence and speed of news dissemination by Dow Jones. In additional analyses, we find that scriptability exhibits both positive and negative associations with changes in information asymmetry between market participants, depending on the filing, trading window, and measure examined. We also find little evidence that XBRL interacts with scriptability in a meaningful way. Overall, our study broadens our understanding of information processing costs and provides opportunities for new avenues of research."
Investor Behavior and the Benefits of Direct Stock Ownership,DARREN BERNARD,22 January 2018,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12198,"ABSTRACTUsing an experiment to rule out reverse causality, we examine whether a small investment in a company's stock leads investors to purchase more of the company's products and adopt other views and preferences that benefit the company. We preregister our research methods, hypotheses, and supplemental analyses via theJournal of Accounting Research’s registration-based editorial process. We find little evidence consistent with these hypotheses for the average investor in our sample using our planned univariate hypothesis tests, and planned Bayesian parameter estimation shows substantial downward belief revision for more optimistic ex ante expectations of the treatment effects. In planned supplemental analyses, however, we do find that the effects of ownership on product purchase behavior and on regulatory preferences are intuitively stronger for certain subgroups of investors—namely, for investors who are most likely to purchase the types of products offered by the company and for investors who are most likely to vote on political matters. The results contribute to our understanding of the benefits of direct stock ownership and are informative to public company managers and directors."
The Tone from Above: The Effect of Communicating a Supportive Regulatory Strategy on Reporting Quality,SANNE R. VAN DUIN,10 February 2018,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12205,"ABSTRACTIn collaboration with the Authority for the Financial Markets in the Netherlands, we manipulate the content of official letters that instruct financial intermediaries to submit a mandatory self-assessment. As part of the Registered Report Process, we submitted our hypotheses, experimental procedure, and planned statistical analyses before data collection. We predicted that a request indicating a supportive regulatory attitude has a positive effect on reporting quality on average. We also predicted this effect to be stronger for small firms and for firms with a long-term orientation, and to become negative for firms with a short-term orientation. Planned analyses show that a supportive letter reduced reporting quality unless firms had a long-term orientation, supporting the moderating influence of time horizon, but providing no support for the expected average effect or for moderation by firm size."
Bridging the Gap: Evidence from Externally Hired CEOs,YONCA ERTIMUR,23 January 2018,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12200,"ABSTRACTWe investigate executive employment gaps (hereafter, gaps) between the appointment of an external CEO at a public firm and the individual's prior executive position at a public company. These gaps cannot be reliably obtained from common databases. We hand-collect data for externally hired CEOs at public companies from 1992 to 2014. These CEOs represent approximately 40% of the 5,095 CEO successions and have a mean gap of 1.9 years. The gap increases to 3.2 years for the subset of new hires with a gap. We hypothesize that labor market frictions and executive skill sets contribute to the existence and length of these gaps. Using theories from labor economics, we predict (equilibrium) associations between two measures of “fit” (executive compensation and long-term match quality) and gaps (both existence and length). Finally, we provide descriptive evidence on what executives do (e.g., sit on boards, work for private consulting companies, or consume leisure) during their gaps. This project was subject to and published through a registered report process. Any tests that were not included in the accepted proposal are marked as unplanned analyses."
Performance Effects of Setting a High Reference Point for Peer-Performance Comparison,HENRY EYRING,24 January 2018,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12199,"ABSTRACTWe conduct a field experiment, based on a registered report accepted by theJournal of Accounting Research, to test performance effects of setting a high reference point for peer-performance comparison. Relative to providing the median as a reference point for online students to compare themselves to, providing the top quartile: damps performance for those below the median, boosts performance for those between the median and top quartile, and, in the case of outcome but not process comparison, boosts performance for those above the top quartile. We do not find that either reference point yields a greater average performance effect. However, providing the more effective reference point in each partition of initial performance yields a 40% greater performance effect than providing either reference point uniformly. Students access the online courses intermittently over the span of a year. Our effects derive from small portions of our treatment groups—5% in the case of process comparison and 26% in the case of outcome comparison—who accessed treatment and who were, on average, more active leading up to and during our intervention."
Corporate Scandals and Regulation,LUZI HAIL,30 January 2018,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12201,"ABSTRACTAre regulatory interventions delayed reactions to market failures or can regulators proactively pre-empt corporate misbehavior? From a public interest view, we would expect “effective” regulation to ex ante mitigate agency conflicts between corporate insiders and outsiders, and prevent corporate misbehavior from occurring or quickly rectify transgressions. However, regulators are also self-interested and may be captured, uninformed, or ideological, and become less effective as a result. In this registered report, we develop a historical time series of corporate (accounting) scandals and (accounting) regulations for a panel of 26 countries from 1800 to 2015. An analysis of the lead-lag relations at both the global and individual country level yields the following insights: (1) Corporate scandals are an antecedent to regulation over long stretches of time, suggesting that regulators are typically less flexible and informed than firms. (2) Regulation is positively related to the incidence of future scandals, suggesting that regulators are not fully effective, that explicit rules are required to identify scandalous corporate actions, or that new regulations have unintended consequences. (3) There exist systematic differences in these lead-lag relations across countries and over time, suggesting that the effectiveness of regulation is shaped by fundamental country characteristics like market development and legal tradition."
The Impact of Consulting Services on Audit Quality: An Experimental Approach,ZACHARY T. KOWALESKI,18 January 2018,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12197,"ABSTRACTWe use experimental markets to examine whether providing consulting services to a non-audit client impacts audit quality. Our paper directly addresses concerns raised by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board that the largest public accounting firms’ growth in their consulting practices threatens audit quality. We conduct an experiment proposed using a registration-based editorial process. We compare a baseline where the auditor does not provide consulting services to conditions where auditors provide consulting to audit clients or where auditors only provide consulting services to non-audit clients. Our unique design provides evidence on whether providing consulting to non-audit clients strengthens the salience of a client-cooperative social norm that reduces audit quality. We do not find differences in audit quality by condition in our planned analysis, however we find greater variation in audit quality in the conditions where auditors provide consulting services compared to the baseline. In unplanned analyses, our results suggest providing consulting services increases auditor cooperation with managers, increasing audit quality when managers prefer high audit quality and decreasing audit quality when managers prefer low audit quality."
"Effects of an Information Sharing System on Employee Creativity, Engagement, and Performance",SHELLEY XIN LI,03 February 2018,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12202,"ABSTRACTMany service organizations rely on information sharing systems to boost employee creativity to meet customer needs. We conducted a field experiment in a retail chain, based on a registered report accepted by JAR, to test whether an information sharing system recording employees’ creative work affected the quality of creative work, job engagement, and financial performance. We found that, on average, this system did not have a significant effect on any of these outcomes. However, it significantly improved the quality of creative work in stores that had accessed the system more frequently and in stores with fewer same-company nearby stores. It also improved creative work and job engagement in stores in divergent markets, where customers needed more customization. We found weak evidence of better financial results where salespeople had lower creative talent before the system was introduced. Our findings shed light on those conditions in which information sharing systems affect employees’ creative work."
How Common Are Intentional GAAP Violations? Estimates from a Dynamic Model,ANASTASIA A. ZAKOLYUKINA,09 November 2017,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12190,"ABSTRACTThis paper uses data on detected misstatements—earnings restatements—and a dynamic model to estimate the extent of undetected misstatements that violate GAAP. The model features a CEO who can manipulate his firm's stock price by misstating earnings. I find the CEO's expected cost of misleading investors is low. The probability of detection over a five-year horizon is 13.91%, and the average misstatement, if detected, results in an 8.53% loss in the CEO's retirement wealth. The low expected cost implies a high fraction of CEOs who misstate earnings at least once at 60%, with 2%–22% of CEOs starting to misstate earnings in each year 2003–2010, inflation in stock prices across CEOs who misstate earnings at 2.02%, and inflation in stock prices across all CEOs at 0.77%. Wealthier CEOs manipulate less, and the average misstatement is larger in smaller firms."
Corporate Loan Securitization and the Standardization of Financial Covenants,ZAHN BOZANIC,05 September 2017,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12186,"ABSTRACTWe examine whether syndicated loans securitized through collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) have more standardized financial covenants. We proxy for the standardization of covenants using the textual similarity of their contractual definitions. We find that securitized loans are associated with higher covenant standardization than nonsecuritized institutional loans. In addition, we show that CLOs with more diverse or frequently rebalanced portfolios are more likely to purchase loans with standardized covenants, potentially because standardization alleviates information processing costs related to loan monitoring and screening. We also document that covenant standardization is associated with greater loan and CLO note rating agreement between credit rating agencies, further supporting the relation between lower information costs and covenant standardization. Overall, our study provides evidence that loan securitization is related to the design of standardized financial covenants."
Linguistic Complexity in Firm Disclosures: Obfuscation or Information?,BRIAN J. BUSHEE,30 June 2017,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12179,"ABSTRACTPrior research generally interprets complex language in firms’ disclosures as indicative of managerial obfuscation. However, complex language can also reflect the provision of complex information; for example, informative technical disclosure. As a consequence, linguistic complexity commingles two latent components—obfuscation and information—that are related to information asymmetry in opposite directions. We develop a novel empirical approach to estimate these two latent components within the context of quarterly earnings conference calls. We validate our estimates of these two latent components by examining their relation to information asymmetry. Consistent with our predictions, we find that our estimate of the information component isnegativelyassociated with information asymmetry while our estimate of the obfuscation component ispositivelyassociated with information asymmetry. Our findings suggest that future research on linguistic complexity can construct more powerful tests by separately examining these two latent components of linguistic complexity."
Whistleblowers and Outcomes of Financial Misrepresentation Enforcement Actions,ANDREW C. CALL,05 May 2017,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12177,"ABSTRACTWhistleblowers are ostensibly a valuable resource to regulators investigating securities violations, but whether there is a link between whistleblower involvement and the outcomes of enforcement actions is unclear. Using a data set of employee whistleblowing allegations obtained from the U.S. government and the universe of enforcement actions for financial misrepresentation, we find that whistleblower involvement is associated with higher monetary penalties for targeted firms and employees and with longer prison sentences for culpable executives. We also find that regulators more quickly begin enforcement proceedings when whistleblowers are involved. Our findings suggest that whistleblowers are a valuable source of information for regulators who investigate and prosecute financial misrepresentation."
Disclosure Regulation in the Commercial Banking Industry: Lessons from the National Banking Era,JOÃO GRANJA,18 December 2017,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12193,ABSTRACTI exploit variation in the adoption of disclosure and supervisory regulation across U.S. states to examine their impact on the development and stability of commercial banks. The empirical results suggest that the adoption of state-level requirements to report financial statements in local newspapers is associated with greater stability and development of commercial banks. I also examine which political constituencies influence the adoption of disclosure and supervisory regulation. I find that powerful landowners and small private banks are associated with late adoption of these regulations. These findings suggest that incumbent groups oppose disclosure rules because the passage of such rules threatens their private interests.
Asymmetric Trading Costs Prior to Earnings Announcements: Implications for Price Discovery and Returns,TRAVIS L. JOHNSON,30 October 2017,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12189,"ABSTRACTWe show that the cost of trading on negative news, relative to positive news, increases before earnings announcements. Our evidence suggests that this asymmetry is due to financial intermediaries reducing their exposure to announcement risks by providing liquidity asymmetrically. This asymmetry creates a predictable upward bias in prices that increases preannouncement, and subsequently reverses, confounding short-window announcement returns as measures of earnings news and risk premia. These findings provide an alternative explanation for asymmetric return reactions to firms' earnings news, and help explain puzzling prior evidence that announcement risk premia precede the actual announcements. Our study informs methods for research centering on earnings announcements and offers a possible explanation for patterns in returns around anticipated periods of heightened inventory risks, including alternative firm-level, industry-level, and macroeconomic information events."
Trade Secrets Law and Corporate Disclosure: Causal Evidence on the Proprietary Cost Hypothesis,YINGHUA LI,19 September 2017,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12187,"ABSTRACTThis study exploits the staggered adoption of the inevitable disclosure doctrine (IDD) by U.S. state courts as an exogenous shock that generates variations in the proprietary costs of disclosure. We find that firms respond to IDD adoption by reducing the level of disclosure regarding their customers’ identities, supporting the proprietary cost hypothesis. Our results are stronger for firms in industries with a higher degree of entry threats, for firms in more volatile industries, and for firms with a lower degree of external financing dependence. Overall, this study represents one of the first efforts in identifying the causal effect of proprietary costs of disclosure on the supply of disclosure."
Commemorating the 50-Year Anniversary of Ball and Brown (1968): The Evolution of Capital Market Research over the Past 50 Years,S. P. KOTHARI,23 July 2019,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12287,"ABSTRACTWe commemorate the 50th anniversary of Ball and Brown [1968] by chronicling its impact on capital market research in accounting. We trace the evolution of various research paths that post–Ball and Brown [1968] researchers took as they sought to build on the foundation laid by Ball and Brown [1968] to create a body of research on the usefulness, timeliness, and other properties of accounting numbers. We discuss how those paths often link back to the groundwork laid and questions originally posed in Ball and Brown [1968]."
The Coordination Role of Stress Tests in Bank Risk-Taking,CARLOS CORONA,17 October 2019,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12288,"ABSTRACTWe examine whether stress tests distort banks' risk-taking decisions. We study a model in which a regulator may choose to rescue banks in the event of concurrent bank failures. Our analysis reveals a novel coordination role of stress tests. Disclosure of stress-test results informs banks of the failure likelihood of other banks, which can reduce welfare by facilitating banks' coordination in risk-taking. However, conducting stress tests also enables the regulator to more effectively intervene banks, coordinating them preemptively into taking lower risks. We find that, if the regulator has a strong incentive to bail out, stress tests improve welfare, whereas if the regulator's incentive to bail out is weak, stress tests impair welfare."
The Value of Precontract Information About an Agent's Ability in the Presence of Moral Hazard and Adverse Selection,RAJIV D. BANKER,25 October 2019,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12290,"ABSTRACTWe analyze the expected value of information about an agent's type in the presence of moral hazard and adverse selection. Information about the agent's type enables the principal to sort/screen agents of different types. The value of the information decreases in the variability of output and the agent's risk aversion, two factors that are typically associated with the severity of the moral hazard problem. However, the value of the information about agent type first increases but ultimately decreases in the severity of adverse selection. The decrease comes about because the means available to the principal to induce effort—namely, the pay–performance sensitivity—must also be used to sort/screen agents, and these two goals conflict. This decline in value occurs despite the monotonically increasing importance of the information in determining the principal's expected profits. Further, we show that the peak value of information occurs at a predictable level of adverse selection. These results imply that over some range, the importance of the information will be increasing, and the value of the information will be simultaneously decreasing, in the severity of adverse selection."
Does Consumer Protection Enhance Disclosure Credibility in Reward Crowdfunding?,STEFANO CASCINO,18 October 2019,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12289,"ABSTRACTWe study how the interplay of disclosure and regulation shapes capital allocation in reward crowdfunding. Using data from Kickstarter, the largest online reward crowdfunding platform, we show that, even in the absence of clear regulation and enforcement mechanisms, disclosure helps entrepreneurs access capital for their projects and bolsters engagement with potential project backers, consistent with the notion that disclosure mitigates moral hazard. We further document that, subsequent to a change in Kickstarter's terms of use that increases the threat of consumer litigation, the association between project funding and disclosure becomes stronger. This evidence suggests that consumer protection regulation enhances the perceived credibility of disclosure. We find the effect of the change in terms of use to be more pronounced in states with stricter consumer protection regulations. Taken together, our findings yield important insights on the role of disclosure, as well as on the potential effects of increased regulation on crowdfunding platforms."
Auditors’ Quantitative Materiality Judgments: Properties and Implications for Financial Reporting Reliability,PREETI CHOUDHARY,03 July 2019,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12286,"ABSTRACTWe analyze data made available through the PCAOB (Public Company Accounting Oversight Board) to provide descriptive evidence on the properties of auditors’ actual quantitative materiality judgments and the implications of those judgments for financial reporting. Auditors’ quantitative materiality judgments do not appear to result simply from applying conventional rules of thumb (e.g., 5% of pretax income), but instead are associated with size-related financial statement outcomes (income, revenues, and assets), where the relative importance of the size-related outcomes varies with client characteristics such as financial performance. Using the distribution of actual materiality amounts reported by auditors to the PCAOB as part of the audit-inspection process, we construct a materiality-judgment measure that locates a specific materiality amount within a normal range that is both comparable across varying client characteristics and supported by guidance in audit firm internal policy manuals. We find that looser materiality (an amount closer to the high end of a normal materiality range) is associated with fewer audit hours and lower audit fees, supporting the construct validity of this measure. We also find that looser materiality is associated with lower amounts of proposed audit adjustments and, in extreme cases, with a greater incidence of restatements, highlighting the importance of auditor materiality assessments for financial reporting reliability."
Hedge Fund Regulation and Fund Governance: Evidence on the Effects of Mandatory Disclosure Rules,COLLEEN HONIGSBERG,06 May 2019,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12270,"ABSTRACTThis paper uses three alternating changes in hedge fund regulation to study whether regulation reduces hedge funds’ misreporting, and, if so, why regulation is effective. Relative to public companies, hedge fund regulation is relatively light. Much of the regime is a “comply-or-explain” framework that allows funds to forego compliance with governance rules, providing that they disclose their lack of compliance. The results show that regulation reduces misreporting at hedge funds. Further analysis suggests that the disclosure requirements led funds to make changes in their internal governance, such as hiring or switching the fund's auditor, and that these changes induced funds to report their financial performance more accurately."
Director–Liability–Reduction Laws and Conditional Conservatism,SUDIPTA BASU,22 March 2019,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12267,"ABSTRACTWe study nonofficer directors’ influence on the accounting conservatism of U.S. public firms. Between 1986 and 2002, all 50 U.S. states enacted laws that limited nonofficer directors’ litigation risk but often left officer directors’ litigation risk unchanged. We find that conditional conservatism decreased after the staggered enactments of the laws, which we attribute to less nonofficer director monitoring of financial reporting in affected firms. Conservatism fell less when shareholder or debtholder power was high, consistent with major stakeholders moderating the influence of nonofficer directors. We verify that our results stem from reductions in the asymmetric timeliness of accruals and, specifically, its current assets components. We also show that affected firms switched away from Big N auditors more often, which reduced these firms’ commitment to conservative financial reports."
The Impact of Information Processing Costs on Firm Disclosure Choice: Evidence from the XBRL Mandate,ELIZABETH BLANKESPOOR,27 March 2019,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12268,"ABSTRACTThis paper examines the effect of market participants’ information processing costs on firms’ disclosure choice. Using the recent eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) regulation, I find that firms increase their quantitative footnote disclosures upon implementation of XBRL detailed tagging requirements designed to reduce information users’ processing costs. These results hold in a difference-in-difference design using matched nonadopting firms as controls, as well as two additional identification strategies. Examination of the disclosure increase by footnote type suggests that both regulatory and nonregulatory market participants play a role in monitoring firm disclosures. Overall, these findings suggest that the processing costs of market participants can be significant enough to impact firms’ disclosure decisions."
Information Intermediary or De Facto Standard Setter? Field Evidence on the Indirect and Direct Influence of Proxy Advisors,CHRISTIE HAYNE,22 February 2019,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12261,"ABSTRACTWe examine whether proxy advisory firms (PAs) serve primarily an information intermediary role by providing research and voting recommendations to shareholders, or directly influence executive compensation by exerting pressure on firms to adopt preferred pay practices. Through a field study, we find that PAs are perceived as both information intermediaries and agenda setters and that these roles provide leverage to enable PAs to exercise significant influence over executive pay practices. Boards feel, and sometimes yield to, pressure to conform to PA “best” practices despite their own preferred compensation philosophies, even in the absence of overt PA scrutiny or negative shareholder votes. We also find that PAs are susceptible to conflicts of interest and generally use a “one-size-fits-all” approach to voting recommendations. Overall, however, PAs are viewed as improving compensation practices by increasing transparency and accountability and fostering dialogue between firms and their shareholders."
Facial Structure and Achievement Drive: Evidence from Financial Analysts,XIANJIE HE,13 February 2019,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12259,"ABSTRACTWe use a large pictorial sample of Chinese financial analysts to test the association between facial width-to-height ratio (fWHR) and performance in men. Financial analysts offer an ideal setting for our investigation because we can objectively track individual analysts’ behaviors and performance. We find that high-fWHRanalysts are more likely to conduct corporate site visits and they exhibit better performance. The positivefWHR–performance association survives a battery of robustness checks and the association is more pronounced for analysts with lower status, for firms with higher uncertainty, and for analysts facing more intense competition. Our results suggest that the dominant trait predicted byfWHRis achievement drive."
Made in the U.S.A.? A Study of Firm Responses to Domestic Production Incentives,REBECCA LESTER,26 April 2019,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12269,"ABSTRACTHow do U.S. companies respond to incentives intended to encourage domestic manufacturing? I study the Domestic Production Activities Deduction (DPAD), which was enacted in the American Jobs Creation Act (AJCA) of 2004 and was the third largest U.S. corporate tax expenditure as of 2017. Using confidential data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, I find greater average domestic investment spending of $95.5–$143.6 million, but only within the sample of domestic-only firms and not until 2010, when the greatest statutory DPAD benefits were available. Additional evidence suggests that U.S. multinational claimants invest abroad rather than in the United States and that the increased investment by DPAD firms is accompanied by a reduction in the domestic workforce, consistent with a substitution of capital for labor. I also show that the delayed investment response is due to firms engaging in other responses first, such as changing corporate reporting to shift income across time and borders. Quantifying the extent of these effects contributes to the literature that studies this tax deduction and informs policy makers as to the effectiveness of both manufacturing incentives and U.S. corporate income tax rate reductions in stimulating real domestic activity."
Do Strict Regulators Increase the Transparency of Banks?,ANNA M. COSTELLO,17 January 2019,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12255,"ABSTRACTWe investigate the role that regulatory strictness plays on the enforcement of financial reporting transparency in the U.S. banking industry. Using a novel measure of regulatory strictness in the enforcement of capital adequacy, we show that strict regulators are more likely to enforce restatements of banks' call reports. Further, we find that the effect of regulatory strictness on accounting enforcement is strongest in periods leading up to economic downturns and for banks with riskier asset portfolios. Overall, the results from our study indicate that regulatory oversight plays an important role in enforcing financial reporting transparency, particularly in periods leading up to economic crises. We interpret this evidence as inconsistent with the idea that strict bank regulators put significant weight on concerns about the potential destabilizing effects of accounting transparency."
Investment Dynamics and Earnings-Return Properties: A Structural Approach,MATTHIAS BREUER,29 December 2018,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12253,"ABSTRACTWe propose the standard neoclassical model of investment under uncertainty with short-run adjustment frictions as a benchmark for earnings-return patterns absent accounting influences. We show that our proposed benchmark generates a wide range of earnings-return patterns documented in accounting research. Notably, our model generates a concave earnings-return relation, similar to that of Basu [1997], and predicts that the earnings-return concavity increases with the volatility of firms’ underlying shock processes and decreases with the level of firms’ investments. We find strong empirical support for these predictions. Overall, our evidence suggests that our proposed benchmark is useful for understanding the joint dynamics of variables of interest to accounting research (e.g., earnings, returns, investment, market-to-book) absent accounting influences, a necessary precondition for inferring the effects of accounting from these dynamics."
Fraud Allegations and Government Contracting,JONAS HEESE,09 February 2019,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12258,"ABSTRACTThis paper examines whether fraud allegations affect firms’ contracting with the government. Using a data set of whistleblower allegations brought under the False Claims Act against firms accused of defrauding the government, we find that federal agencies do not reduce the total dollar volume of contracts with accused firms; however, they substitute approximately 14% of the harder-to-monitor cost-plus contracts for fixed-price contracts. This effect is concentrated in the procurement of services and explained by contract and service substitution. Finally, we find that after the conclusion of the investigation, the government reduces the contract dollar volume by approximately 15% for cases that resulted in a settlement. Our findings indicate that contract-design changes are used to mitigate uncertainty in suppliers’ reputation."
Do Corporate Governance Analysts Matter? Evidence from the Expansion of Governance Analyst Coverage,NICO LEHMANN,24 December 2018,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12254,"ABSTRACTThis paper examines the economic consequences of the initiation of governance analyst coverage. Governance analysts process, enhance, and disseminate governance-related information to capital market participants via, for example, governance reports and ratings. Using an exogenous shock in the United Kingdom, I find that an increase in governance analyst coverage results in increased governance quality, improved liquidity, increased financial analyst following, and improved investor breadth. These findings are consistent with governance analysts creating value for firms via monitoring, information dissemination/production, and investor recognition."
Is Investor Attention for Sale? The Role of Advertising in Financial Markets,JOSHUA MADSEN,06 February 2019,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12257,"ABSTRACTPrior research documents capital market benefits of increased investor attention to accounting disclosures and media coverage; however, little is known about how investors and markets respond to attention-grabbing events that reveal little nonpublic information. We use daily firm advertising data to test how advertisements, which are designed to attract consumers' attention, influence investors' attention and financial markets (i.e., spillover effects). Exploiting the fact that firms often advertise at weekly intervals, we use an instrumental variables approach to provide evidence that print ads, especially in business publications, trigger temporary spikes in investor attention. We further find that trading volume and quoted dollar depths increase on days with ads in a business publication. We contribute to research on how management choices influence firms' information environments, determinants and consequences of investor attention, and consequences of advertising for financial markets."
Consequences of Debt Forgiveness: Strategic Default Contagion and Lender Learning,GERARDO PÉREZ-CAVAZOS,09 December 2018,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12252,"ABSTRACTI use a unique data set of loans to small business owners to examine whether lenders face adverse consequences when they grant debt forgiveness to borrowers. I provide evidence consistent with borrowers communicating their debt forgiveness to other borrowers, who then more frequently strategically default on their own obligations. This strategic default contagion is economically large. When the lender doubles debt forgiveness, the default rate increases by 10.9% on average. Using an exogenous shock to the lender's forgiveness policy, my findings suggest that as the lender learns about the extent of borrower communication the lender tightens its debt forgiveness policy to mitigate default contagion."
The Role of Gatekeepers in Capital Markets,SUGATA ROYCHOWDHURY,14 March 2019,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12266,"ABSTRACTGatekeepers in financial markets have the power to provide the institutional stability, fortitude, and direction necessary for the development and the smooth functioning of capital markets. At the same time, they are often motivated by their own private incentives. This along with the tradeoffs they face, and the at-times unintended consequences of the regulations they propose and enforce, can undermine their effectiveness. A thorough understanding of gatekeepers and their roles can thus illuminate academics, the financial community, and regulators on how such gatekeepers can be the most effective and generate the greatest benefits for capital markets. Since gatekeeping roles and the literature they have inspired encompass a wide array of institutions and agencies, our overview concentrates on those that the conference papers appearing in this volume focus on. We conclude that collectively, the papers contribute to significant progress, and point out some crucial areas that call for further investigation and offer opportunities for future research."
Do Rating Agencies Benefit from Providing Higher Ratings? Evidence from the Consequences of Municipal Bond Ratings Recalibration,ANNE BEATTY,25 March 2019,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12263,"ABSTRACTWe ask whether credit rating agencies receive higher fees and gain greater market share when they provide more favorable ratings. To investigate this question, we use the 2010 rating scale recalibration by Moody's and Fitch, which increased ratings absent any underlying change in issuer credit quality. Consistent with prior research, we find that the recalibration allowed the clients of Moody's and Fitch to receive better ratings and lower yields. We add to this evidence by showing that the recalibration also led to larger fees and to increases in the market shares of Moody's and Fitch. These results are consistent with critics’ concerns about the effects of the issuer-pay model on the credit ratings market."
An Investigation of Auditors’ Judgments When Companies Release Earnings Before Audit Completion,LORI SHEFCHIK BHASKAR,07 March 2019,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12262,"ABSTRACTThe majority of U.S. public companies release annual earnings prior to the completion of audit fieldwork. We investigate this phenomenon in a controlled experiment with audit partners and senior managers. We find that releasing earnings before completion of the audit pressures auditors to adopt the goals of management, thereby reducing the likelihood of post-announcement audit-adjustment recommendations. We also examine the effect of audit committee (AC) strength in improving auditors’ judgments after annual earnings are released. When ACs are actively involved in accounting issues and proactively communicating with auditors—characteristics currently lacking in most ACs—the negative effects on auditors’ judgments are completely mitigated. Our study provides evidence on potential unintended consequences of early release of earnings and the importance of investing in high-quality ACs to mitigate adverse effects of client pressures on audit judgment and financial reporting quality."
The Disciplinary Role of Financial Statements: Evidence from Mergers and Acquisitions of Privately Held Targets,CIAO-WEI CHEN,28 January 2019,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12256,"ABSTRACTThis study examines whether requiring the disclosure of audited financial statements disciplines managers’ mergers and acquisitions (M&As) decisions. When an M&A transaction meets certain disclosure thresholds, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires the public acquirer to disclose the target's audited financial statements after the merger is completed. Using hand-collected data, I find that the disclosure of private targets’ financial statements is associated with better acquisition decisions. Furthermore, I find that this disciplining effect of disclosure is more pronounced when monitoring by outside capital providers is more difficult and costly, and when other disciplining mechanisms are weaker. Finally, these findings are robust to several alternative explanations, such as monitoring from blockholders and voluntary disclosures. In sum, the evidence suggests that the ex post mandatory disclosure of private targets’ accounting information disciplines managers’ acquisition decisions and improves acquisition efficiency."
Federal Judge Ideology: A New Measure of Ex Ante Litigation Risk,ALLEN HUANG,22 February 2019,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12260,"ABSTRACTDrawing on the political theory of judicial decision making, our paper proposes a new and parsimonious ex ante litigation risk measure: federal judge ideology. We find that judge ideology complements existing measures of litigation risk based on industry membership and firm characteristics. Firms in liberal circuits (the third quartile in ideology) are 33.5% more likely to be sued in securities class action lawsuits than those in conservative circuits (the first quartile in ideology). This result is stronger after the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in theTellabscase. We next show that the effect of judge ideology on litigation risk is greater for firms with more sophisticated shareholders and with higher expected litigation costs. Furthermore, judicial appointments affect litigation risk and the value of firms in the circuit, highlighting the economic consequences of political appointments of judges. Finally, using our new measure, we document that litigation risk deters managers from providing long-term earnings guidance, a result that existing measures of litigation risk cannot show."
Financial Gatekeepers and Investor Protection: Evidence from Criminal Background Checks,KELVIN K. F. LAW,14 March 2019,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12265,"ABSTRACTWe examine whether financial advisors with pre-advisor criminal records pose a greater risk to investors than those without. We find that financial advisors with pre-advisor criminal records are more likely to receive future customer complaints. Their complaints are more likely to receive arbitration awards or settlements and are more likely to involve large settlements exceeding $100,000. Finally, clients are more likely to suffer service disruptions from engaging advisors with pre-advisor criminal records, even incremental to the brokerage firm being high-risk. Although we do not have performance data of individual advisors, mutual funds of those firms that employ advisors with criminal records do not provide their clients with superior returns nor charge lower fees, suggesting that there are not compensating benefits to offset the investor harm. Overall, pre-advisor criminal record serves as an important ex ante characteristic available to regulators, investors, and employers for risk-assessment purposes."
Financial Reporting and Credit Ratings: On the Effects of Competition in the Rating Industry and Rating Agencies' Gatekeeper Role,KYUNGHA (KARI) LEE,12 March 2019,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12264,"AbstractThis paper studies firms' financial reporting incentives in the presence of strategic credit rating agencies and how these incentives are affected by the level of competition in the rating industry and by rating agencies' role as gatekeepers to debt markets. We develop a model featuring an entrepreneur who seeks project financing from a perfectly competitive debt market. After publicly disclosing a financial report, the entrepreneur can purchase credit ratings from rating agencies that strategically choose their rating fees and rating inflation. We derive the following core results: (1) More rating industry competition leads to stronger corporate misreporting incentives if ratings are sufficiently precise or if rating agencies assume a gatekeeper role. Under imperfect rating industry competition, (2) agencies' gatekeeper role primarily weakens firms' misreporting incentives, which then influences rating agencies' strategies, and (3) firms' misreporting and rating agencies' rating inflation can be strategic complements when agencies assume a gatekeeper role. (4) Regulatory initiatives aimed at increasing rating industry competition or at weakening rating agencies' gatekeeper role improve investment efficiency as long as corporate misreporting incentives are not significantly strengthened."
Management by the Numbers: A Formal Approach to Deriving Informational and Distributional Properties of “Unmanaged” Earnings,THOMAS HEMMER,26 October 2018,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12249,"ABSTRACTWe explore the theoretical relation between earnings and market returns as well as the properties of earnings frequency distributions under the assumption that managers use unbiased accounting information to sequentially decide on real options their firms have and report generated earnings truthfully, with the market pricing the firm based on those reported earnings. We generate benchmarks against which empirically observed earnings-returns relations and aggregate earnings distributions can be evaluated. This parsimonious model shows a coherent set of results: reported losses are less persistent than reported gains, decision making diminishes the S-shaped market response to earnings and earnings relate to returns asymmetrically in the way documented by Basu [1997]. Furthermore, the implied frequency distribution of aggregate earnings is neither symmetric nor necessarily single-peaked. Instead, it may exhibit a kink at zero and look similar to the plots reported by Burgstahler and Dichev [1997]. However, within our model, none of these phenomena are due to reporting noise, bias, or some undesirable strategic managerial behavior. They are the natural consequences of using past earnings as the basis for value increasing managerial decision making that in turn generates the future earnings on which future decisions will be based."
Why Do Individual Investors Disregard Accounting Information? The Roles of Information Awareness and Acquisition Costs,ELIZABETH BLANKESPOOR,23 October 2018,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12248,"ABSTRACTWe investigate the frictions that impede individual investors’ use of accounting information and, in particular, their costs of monitoring and acquiring accounting disclosures. We do so using an archival setting in which individuals are presented with automated media articles that report both current earnings news and past stock returns. Although these investors have earnings information readily available, we find no evidence that their trades incorporate it. Instead we find that their trading responds to the trailing stock returns presented in the articles. Our study raises questions about the efficacy of regulations that aim to aid less sophisticated investors by increasing their awareness of and access to accounting information."
The Effects of Analyst-Country Institutions on Biased Research: Evidence from Target Prices,MARK T. BRADSHAW,21 September 2018,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12245,"ABSTRACTPrior research demonstrates that a strong institutional infrastructure in a country moderates self-serving behavior of market participants. Cross-country economic activities have increased significantly, presenting a research opportunity to examine the relative influence of local versus foreign institutional infrastructure on individual market participants. We utilize variation in analyst-country location relative to covered firm location to examine institutional determinants of optimism in analyst research. Focusing on target prices, where persistent optimism is well documented, we find that analysts domiciled in countries with stronger institutional infrastructures exhibit significantly attenuated target price optimism and more value-relevant target prices. Our results demonstrate the importance of domestic country-level institutional factors in moderating self-serving behavior of market participants engaged in cross-country activities."
Effects of Increasing Enforcement on Financial Reporting Quality and Audit Quality,RALF EWERT,29 November 2018,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12251,"ABSTRACTA widely held assumption in policy making and empirical research is that increasing the strength of public enforcement improves financial reporting quality and audit quality. This paper provides a more nuanced view. In a model with a manager who can manage earnings, a strategic auditor, and an enforcement institution, we show that enforcement and auditing are complements in a weak enforcement regime but can be substitutes in a strong regime. Although stronger enforcement always mitigates earnings management, the effects of different instruments of strengthening enforcement are ambiguous. We show that they can improve or impair financial reporting quality and audit quality, depending on production risk, accounting system characteristics, and the scope of auditing relative to enforcement."
Banks as Tax Planning Intermediaries,JOHN GALLEMORE,19 October 2018,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12246,"ABSTRACTWe provide the first large-scale empirical evidence of banks functioning as tax planning intermediaries. We posit that some banks specialize in assisting corporate clients with tax planning. In this role, banks make use of their centrality in financial relationships; access to private information; and ability to structure, execute, and participate in tax planning transactions for clients. We measure bank-client relationships using loan contracts and measure client tax planning using either the cash effective tax rate or the unrecognized tax benefit balance. Using a difference-in-differences design, we find that firms experience meaningful tax reductions when they begin a relationship with a bank whose existing clients engage in above-median tax planning. The effects of pairing with such tax intermediary banks are concentrated in relationships with larger or longer maturity loans, clients with foreign income or greater credit risk, and when the bank is an industry specialist or has above-median investment banking activities. Finally, we find that potential clients are more likely to choose tax intermediary banks than nontax intermediary banks, suggesting that tax intermediary banks benefit by attracting new business. Collectively, our results suggest that some banks act as tax planning intermediaries, a role beyond the traditional one of financial intermediary."
Relative Target Setting and Cooperation,MARTIN HOLZHACKER,19 September 2018,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12244,"ABSTRACTA large stream of work on relative performance evaluation highlights the benefits of using information about peer performance in contracting. In contrast, the potential costs of discouraging cooperation among peers have received much less attention. The purpose of our study is to examine how the importance of cooperation affects the use of information about peer performance in target setting, also known as relative target setting. Specifically, we use data from an industrial services company where business unit managers need to share specialized equipment and staff with their peers to manage bottlenecks in their capacity. We construct several empirical proxies for the costs and benefits of information about peer performance and examine their effects on target setting. We find robust evidence that the sensitivity of target revisions to past peer performance is higher when peer group performance has greater capacity to filter out noise but lower when the importance of cooperation among peers is greater."
"International Mergers and Acquisitions Laws, the Market for Corporate Control, and Accounting Conservatism",INDER K. KHURANA,29 October 2018,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12247,"ABSTRACTExploiting the staggered enactment of country-level mergers and acquisitions (M&A) law as an exogenous increase in corporate takeover threat, this paper examines how a disciplinary market for corporate control affects accounting conservatism. Following M&A law adoption, we find increased accounting conservatism, with more pronounced effects in countries with weak shareholder protection and in those experiencing larger growth in takeover activity. Further analysis reveals that elevated takeover threats increase conservatism through changes in capital structure and investment decisions as well as improvements in board monitoring. Our findings highlight the importance of the market for corporate control in shaping financial-reporting outcome."
The Effect of Mandatory Extraction Payment Disclosures on Corporate Payment and Investment Policies Abroad,THOMAS RAUTER,18 August 2020,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12332,"ABSTRACTI examine how mandatory extraction payment disclosures (EPD)—a policy solution intended to discourage corporate payment avoidance in the oil, gas, and mining industries—affect fiscal revenue contributions and investments by multinational firms in foreign host countries. Using the staggered adoption of EPD across firms headquartered in Europe and Canada, I find that disclosing companies increase their payments to host governments, decrease investments, and obtain fewer extraction licenses relative to non-disclosing competitors. These effects are stronger for firms that face a high risk of public shaming, operate in corrupt host countries, and have a high exposure to bribery-prone payments, suggesting that EPD increases the reputational cost of corporate behavior that could be perceived as exploitative. The resulting reallocation of investments from disclosing to non-disclosing firms reduces drilling productivity and resource production in host countries, consistent with uneven disclosure regulation distorting capital allocation."
Corporate Tax Enforcement Externalities and the Banking Sector,JOHN GALLEMORE,16 September 2020,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12334,"ABSTRACTWe explore whether corporate tax enforcement can affect bank lending. Specifically, we hypothesize that tax enforcement efforts aimed at small and midsized enterprises (SME) can improve their information environments, which in turn could lead to increased bank commercial lending. Exploiting the regional structure employed by the IRS until 1999, we find that the corporate tax return audit probability for SMEs is associated with greater commercial lending growth for regionally focused banks. We find similar evidence when exploiting the IRS reorganization from a regional to federal system in 2000. Further results show that tax enforcement's impact on SME informational environments is at least partially responsible for this association: The impact of tax auditing on bank lending is stronger for banks facing greater informational disadvantages and in areas where SMEs face greater hold-up problems. Finally, we find that the tax audit rate is positively associated with loan portfolio quality, suggesting that tax enforcement can lead to better loan decisions. Our findings are consistent with the tax authority's mandate having important externalities on bank lending and SME access to capital, suggesting that the benefits to tax enforcement go beyond improving tax collection."
The Effect of Managerial Litigation Risk on Earnings Warnings: Evidence from a Natural Experiment,YING HUANG,25 September 2020,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12336,"ABSTRACTWe examine the causal effect of managerial litigation risk on managers’ disclosure of earnings warnings in the face of large earnings shortfalls. Exploring the staggered adoption of universal demand (UD) laws as an exogenous decrease in litigation risk, we find that the adoption leads to a decrease in managers’ issuance of earnings warnings, especially among firms facing a higher litigation risk prior to the adoption. In contrast, we find no change in managers’ tendency to alert investors of impending large positive earnings surprises. Collectively, our results provide causal evidence that higher litigation risk incentivizes managers to issue more earnings warnings. Our results differ from Bourveau et al.’s finding of an increase in the frequency of management earnings forecasts after the adoption of UD laws. We reconcile our findings with theirs by demonstrating that the effect of adopting UD laws on management earnings forecasts depends critically on forecast horizon: The adoption increases long-horizon forecasts, but decreases short-horizon forecasts."
Resolving Information Asymmetry Through Contractual Risk Sharing: The Case of Private Firm Acquisitions,MARK JANSEN,18 September 2020,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12335,"ABSTRACTWhen private firms are acquired, buyers commonly rely on seller financing and earnouts. Using a novel database of private acquisitions, I find that seller financing and earnouts become more common as information asymmetry increases between the acquirer and the target. Financial statement audits of the targets attenuate these results, which suggests that audits decrease information asymmetry in firm acquisitions. Seller-financed acquisitions also close faster and at higher prices, reducing the private firm discount. These findings suggest that these contract structures are an important channel through which privately held firms mitigate adverse selection that arises from information asymmetry."
Do Firms Strategically Internalize Disclosure Spillovers? Evidence from Cash-Financed M&As,JINHWAN KIM,13 October 2020,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12337,"ABSTRACTWe investigate whether managers internalize the spillover effects of their disclosure on the stock price of related firms and strategically alter their disclosure decisions when doing so is beneficial. Using data on firm-initiated disclosures during all-cash acquisitions, we find evidence consistent with acquirers strategically generating news that they expect will depress the target's stock price. Our results suggest the disclosure strategy leads to lower target returns during the negotiation period when the takeover price is being determined and results in a lower target premium. These findings are robust to a battery of specifications and falsification tests. Our results are consistent with expected spillovers influencing the timing and content of firms’ disclosures in M&A transactions."
Opening Up the “Black Box” of Audit Firms: The Effects of Audit Partner Ownership on Audit Adjustments,CLIVE LENNOX,06 September 2020,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12333,"ABSTRACTAudit firms need to provide high-quality audits but they also need to please their clients. We argue that these conflicting incentives become manifest when comparing the incentive effects of equity ownership on engagement quality (EQ) reviewers and audit engagement partners. We predict that EQ reviewers monitor audit quality more closely when they hold greater ownership. In contrast, we expect that equity ownership has conflicting effects on the incentives of engagement partners because they need to please their clients as well as provide high-quality audits. Consistent with these predictions, we find that the associations between audit adjustments and partner equity ownership are (1) significantly positive for EQ reviewers, (2) significantly negative or insignificant for audit engagement partners, and (3) significantly more positive for EQ reviewers than engagement partners. Our findings suggest that larger ownership stakes motivate EQ reviewers to monitor audit quality more closely, whereas larger ownership stakes do not motivate engagement partners to deliver higher quality audits."
Screening Talent for Task Assignment: Absolute or Percentile Thresholds?,RAMJI BALAKRISHNAN,24 June 2020,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12327,"ABSTRACTMatching talents to tasks is an important part of job design. Organizations routinely use performance thresholds to group agents by talent. We see thresholds defined both in terms of an individual's own performance (absolute value) and in terms of peer performance (percentile). Intuition suggests a preference for percentile thresholds because the resulting rank-order statistic is sufficient to assess relative talent. Yet, in the context of a task assignment problem in which the objective is to match talent with task type (using two agents and two task types), we show that absolute thresholds can dominate percentile thresholds under either of two conditions. First, flexibility in task assignment tilts the balance toward absolute thresholds. Second, performance manipulation can adversely affect the inherent advantage of percentile thresholds because they motivate agents to invest relatively more in personally costly influence activities to cast their performance in a favorable light. We examine how these results hold up when there are countably large number of agents and discuss empirical implications."
Tick Size and Financial Reporting Quality in Small-Cap Firms: Evidence from a Natural Experiment,ANWER S. AHMED,17 July 2020,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12331,"ABSTRACTUsing a natural experiment (the SEC's 2016 Tick Size Pilot Program), we investigate the effects of an increase in tick size on financial reporting quality. The tick size pilot program reduces algorithmic trading (AT) and increases fundamental investors’ information acquisition and trading activities. This in turn increases the scrutiny of managers’ financial reporting choices and reduces their incentives to engage in misreporting. Using a difference-in-differences research design, we find a significant decrease in the magnitude of discretionary accruals, a significant reduction in the likelihood of just meeting or beating analysts’ forecasts, and a marginally significant decrease in restatements for the treated firms in the pilot program. Furthermore, we find that the change in financial reporting quality is concentrated in treated firms experiencing decreases in AT and increases in information acquisition activities. We also find that the mispricing of accruals is significantly lower for treated firms. Taken together, our results suggest that an increase in tick size has a causal effect on firms’ financial reporting quality."
Politically Connected Governments,CHRISTINE CUNY,14 May 2020,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12325,"ABSTRACTThis paper examines the consequences of powerful political connections for local governments. We find that governments located within the constituencies of, and thus connected to, powerful congressional members reduce their stewardship over public resources. Using plausibly exogenous declines in the power of congressional representation, we show that the effect is causal. To better understand why connected local governments can reduce stewardship, we study electoral characteristics. Our findings suggest that the increased resources that come with powerful congressional representation allow local-government officials to reduce stewardship without material adverse effects on their reelection prospects. In sum, we provide evidence of a cost of political connections: they weaken local governments' incentives to act in a socially optimal manner."
"Foreign Exchange Risk, Hedging, and Tax-Motivated Outbound Income Shifting",ZERO DENG,19 June 2020,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12326,"ABSTRACTAlthough outbound income shifting to low-tax jurisdictions provides tax savings, it is often accompanied by nontax costs. In this study, I examine whether foreign exchange (FX) risk constrains tax-motivated outbound income shifting by U.S. multinational corporations. My findings indicate that exposure to greater currency volatility is associated with less outbound income shifting, and this effect is stronger for firms with foreign affiliates using foreign functional currencies. I also investigate whether hedging facilitates outbound income shifting. Consistent with hedging lowering costs associated with exchange rate volatility, I find that U.S. firms that use more currency derivatives tend to shift more income to low-tax foreign jurisdictions. Overall, these findings suggest that FX risk is an important cost of outbound income shifting."
Asymmetric Cost Behavior and Dividend Policy,JIE HE,10 July 2020,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12328,"ABSTRACTCosts are sticky on average, that is, they fall less for sales decreases than they rise for equivalent sales increases. We examine the effect of this asymmetric cost behavior on a firm's dividend policy. Given investors’ aversion to dividend cuts, we predict that firms with higher resource adjustment costs and stickier costs pay lower dividends than their peers because they are less able to sustain any higher level of dividend payouts in the future. We find evidence consistent with this prediction. Further, using a regression discontinuity design that exploits variation in labor adjustment costs generated by close-call union elections, we provide evidence suggesting that the negative relation between cost stickiness and dividend payouts is driven by resource adjustment costs. Our paper sheds new light on the determinants of dividend policy and demonstrates the role of cost behavior in corporate decisions."
Disclosing Physician Ratings: Performance Effects and the Difficulty of Altering Ratings Consensus,HENRY EYRING,19 July 2020,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12330,"ABSTRACTI examine effects of a health care system's policy to publicly disclose patient ratings of its physicians. I find evidence that this policy leads to performance improvement by the disclosed, subjective ratings and also by undisclosed, objective measures of quality. These effects are consistent with multitasking theory, in that physicians respond to the disclosure by providing more of a shared input—time with patients—that benefits performance by ratings and underlying quality. I also find, as predicted by information cascade theory, that the ratings become jammed to some degree near initially disclosed values. Specifically, raters observe the pattern of initial ratings and follow suit by providing similar ratings. Finally, I find evidence that physicians anticipate rating jamming and so concentrate their effort on earlier performance in order to set a pattern of high ratings that later ratings follow. These results demonstrate that the disclosure of subjective ratings can benefit performance broadly but can also shift effort toward earlier performance."
The Silent Majority: Private U.S. Firms and Financial Reporting Choices,PETRO LISOWSKY,06 April 2020,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12306,"ABSTRACTThis study uses a comprehensive panel of tax returns to examine the financial reporting choices of medium-to-large private U.S. firms, a setting that controls over $9 trillion in capital, vastly outnumbers public U.S. firms across all industries, yet has no financial reporting mandates. We find that nearly two-thirds of these firms do not produce audited GAAP financial statements. Guided by an agency theory framework, we find that size, ownership dispersion, external debt, and trade credit are positively associated with the choice to produce audited GAAP financial statements, while asset tangibility, age, and internal debt are generally negatively related to this choice. Our findings reveal that (1) equity capital and trade credit exhibit significant explanatory power, suggesting that the primary focus in the literature on debt is too narrow; (2) firm youth, growth, and R&D are positively associated with audited GAAP reporting, reflecting important monitoring roles of financial reporting; and (3) many firms violate standard explanations for financial reporting choices and substantial unexplained heterogeneity in financial reporting remains. We conclude by identifying opportunities for future research."
Why Do Politicians Intervene in Accounting Regulation? The Role of Ideology and Special Interests,JANNIS BISCHOF,03 February 2020,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12300,"ABSTRACTPoliticians frequently intervene in the regulation of financial accounting. Evidence from the accounting literature shows that regulatory capture by special interests helps explain these interventions. However, many accounting rules have broad economic or social consequences, such as their effects on income distribution or private sector subsidies. The perception of these consequences varies with a politician's ideology. Therefore, if accounting rules produce those consequences, ideology plausibly spills over and explains a politician's stance on the technical accounting issue, beyond special interest pressure. We use two prominent U.S. political debates about fair value accounting and the expensing of employee stock options to disentangle the role of ideology from special interest pressure. In both debates, ideology explains politicians’ involvement at exactly those points when the debate focuses on the economic consequences of accounting regulation (i.e., bank bailouts and top management compensation). Once the debates focus on more technical issues, connections to special interests remain the dominant force."
Strategic Subsidiary Disclosure,SCOTT D. DYRENG,15 April 2020,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12308,"ABSTRACTAlthough subsidiary disclosures in firms’ filings with the Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC; Exhibit 21) represent the most granular required public disclosure of a firm's geographic footprint, little is understood about the quality of the disclosure, and anecdotal evidence suggests firms may not fully comply with the disclosure requirements. We use data provided by multinational firms to the Internal Revenue Service regarding their foreign subsidiary locations to explore the accuracy of public subsidiary disclosures on Exhibit 21 of Form 10-K per SEC rules. The overall incidence of nondisclosure is low, suggesting that most firms comply with Exhibit 21 disclosure rules, and that for most applications, Exhibit 21 disclosures provide a reasonable proxy for locations of significant subsidiaries. Nevertheless, there is some evidence of nondisclosure, particularly when subsidiaries are in tax havens, when the firm is more highly scrutinized in the media, or when the firm has other characteristics consistent with low-quality disclosures such as SEC comment letters."
The Effect of Credit Ratings on Disclosure: Evidence from the Recalibration of Moody's Municipal Ratings,JACQUELYN R. GILLETTE,15 April 2020,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12307,"ABSTRACTThis paper examines how credit rating levels affect municipal debt issuers’ disclosure decisions. Using exogenous upgrades in credit rating levels caused by the recalibration of Moody's municipal ratings scale in 2010, we find that upgraded municipalities significantly reduce their disclosure of required continuing financial information, relative to unaffected municipalities. Consistent with a reduction in debtholders’ demand for information driving these results, the reduction in disclosure is greater when municipal bonds are held by investors who relied more on disclosure ex ante. However, we also find that the reduction in disclosure does not manifest when issuers are monitored by underwriters with greater issuer-specific expertise and when issuers are subject to direct regulatory enforcement through the receipt of federal funding. Overall, our results suggest that higher credit rating levels lower investor demand for disclosure in the municipal market, and highlight the role of underwriters and direct regulatory enforcement in maintaining disclosure levels when investor demand is low."
How Does Using a Mobile Device Change Investors’ Reactions to Firm Disclosures?,STEPHANIE M. GRANT,24 January 2020,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12299,"ABSTRACTI examine how characteristics of investors’ information access tools change investors’ reactions to firm disclosures. I examine my research question in the context of information choice (i.e., allowing investors to choose the order of information and sections to read within a disclosure) and spatial layout (i.e., how information is displayed when viewing the disclosure). Results of an experiment are consistent with information choice improving investors’ judgments if the disclosure is viewed on a computer screen. Conversely, and consistent with cognitive overload, information choice harms investors’ judgments if the disclosure is viewed on a smaller screen, such as that of a mobile device. Follow-up experiments show that changing the disclosure presentation to reduce the need to scroll is one way to improve investors’ judgments on a smaller (or mobile) screen. My findings caution firms and regulators about expanding information choice within disclosures without considering the screen size used to access the disclosure."
Public Attention and Auditor Behavior: The Case of Hurun Rich List in China,DONGHUI WU,21 April 2020,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12309,"ABSTRACTAdverse client publicity can entail regulatory scrutiny over audited financial statements and impose political costs on auditors. We use the changes in client publicity caused by their controlling owners’ presence on theHurun Rich List(the rich listing) in China to test the hypothesis that auditor conservatism increases with client publicity. Our evidence indicates auditors issue more adverse audit opinions to clients and charge higher fees following the rich listing events. Moreover, we observe that auditors strategically respond to clients with different attributes—for clients whose owners accumulated wealth in a more questionable manner, auditors choose more stringent audit reporting to better defend themselves from regulatory scrutiny; for clients without such attributes, auditors primarily rely on increasing audit fees to cope with any post-listing increase in audit risks. Our analyses also suggest the impacts of rich listings tend to be concentrated among large audit firms with stronger reputation concerns or among engagement auditors with more conservative reporting styles. By showing how auditors manage political risks associated with heightened public scrutiny, we contribute to both the auditing and political cost literature."
Corporate Disclosure as a Tacit Coordination Mechanism: Evidence from Cartel Enforcement Regulations,THOMAS BOURVEAU,20 February 2020,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12301,"ABSTRACTWe empirically study how collusion in product markets affects firms' financial disclosure strategies. We find that after a rise in cartel enforcement, U.S. firms start sharing more detailed information in their financial disclosure about their customers, contracts, and products. This new information potentially benefits peers by helping to tacitly coordinate actions in product markets. Indeed, changes in disclosure are associated with higher future profitability. Our results highlight the potential conflict between securities and antitrust regulations."
Does Private Country-by-Country Reporting Deter Tax Avoidance and Income Shifting? Evidence from BEPS Action Item 13,PREETIKA JOSHI,13 March 2020,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12304,"ABSTRACTTo combat tax avoidance by multinational corporations, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development introduced country-by-country reporting (CbCr), requiring firms to provide tax authorities with a geographic breakdown of their profitability and activities. Treating the introduction of CbCr in the European Union as a shock to private disclosure requirements, this study examines the effect on corporate tax outcomes. Exploiting the €750 million revenue threshold for disclosure and employing regression-discontinuity and difference-in-differences designs, I document a 1–2 percentage point increase in consolidated GAAP effective tax rates among affected firms. I also find evidence consistent with a decline in tax-motivated income shifting, starting in 2018. These results suggest that, although private geographic disclosures can deter corporate tax avoidance, so far, the regulations have had a limited effect on tax-motivated income shifting. My findings have policy implications for the global implementation of private CbCr and extend the debate on public versus private disclosure of tax information."
Contracts Between Firms and Shareholders,JORDAN SCHOENFELD,13 January 2020,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12297,"ABSTRACTTheory predicts the existence of explicit bilateral contracts between firms and expert shareholders. I assemble and analyze a large-scale data set of these contracts. Using block investments from 1996 to 2018, I find that these contracts involve mainly corporate owners and activist owners, and often specify covenants pertaining to financing, trading, directorships, dividends, joint ventures, corporate investment, financial reporting, and information access. I also find that some of the contract covenants are stated in terms of accounting information, and that the prevalence of these contracts is significantly positively associated with measures of information asymmetry between managers and shareholders. Overall, this study provides some of the first systematic evidence on explicit bilateral contracts between firms and shareholders."
Paper Versus Practice: A Field Investigation of Integrity Hotlines,EUGENE SOLTES,04 March 2020,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12302,"ABSTRACTIn an effort to motivate firms to more rapidly detect potential misconduct, legislators, regulators, and enforcement agencies incentivize firms to have integrity or “whistleblowing” hotlines. These hotlines provide individuals an opportunity to report alleged misconduct and seek guidance about how to appropriately respond. Beyond some isolated examples, little is known about the responsiveness of hotlines to actual claims of alleged misconduct. I undertake a field study to investigate how hotlines function in practice by making four different inquiries involving alleged misconduct to nearly 250 firms. I find that one-fifth of firms have impediments (e.g., phone line disconnected, email bounce back, direct to incorrect website) that hinder reporting and approximately 10% of firms do not respond in a timely manner. Overall, this investigation illuminates several differences between integrity hotlines “on paper” and how they actually perform in practice."
Evidence on the Use and Efficacy of Internal Whistleblowing Systems,STEPHEN R. STUBBEN,04 March 2020,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12303,"ABSTRACTUsing a proprietary data set from a provider of internal whistleblowing (WB) systems, we analyze nearly two million internal WB reports submitted to over 1,000 publicly traded U.S. firms. We provide descriptive statistics, over time and across report types, on the amount and summary details of information provided, how extensively management reviews reports, the amount of time until reviews were completed, and the outcome of these reviews. Further, we examine the characteristics of firms with more actively used systems (i.e., a higher volume of reports, more information provided in reports, and reports that are more frequently reviewed by management). Finally, we show that internal WB report volume is associated with fewer and lower amounts of government fines and material lawsuits."
Reproducibility in Accounting Research: Views of the Research Community,LUZI HAIL,18 March 2020,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12305,"ABSTRACTWe have little knowledge about the prevalence of irreproducibility in the accounting literature. To narrow this gap, we conducted a survey among the participants of the 2019 JAR Conference on their perceptions of the frequency, causes, and consequences of irreproducible research published in accounting journals. A majority of respondents believe that irreproducibility is common in the literature, constitutes a major problem, and receives too little attention. Most have encountered irreproducibility in the work of others (although not in their own work) but chose not to pursue their failed reproduction attempts to publication. Respondents believe irreproducibility results chiefly from career or publication incentives as well as from selective reporting of results. They also believe that practices like sharing code and data combined with stronger incentives to replicate the work of others would enhance reproducibility. The views of accounting researchers are remarkably similar to those expressed in a survey by the scientific journalNature. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings and provide several potential paths forward for the accounting research community."
The Politics of M&A Antitrust,MIHIR N. MEHTA,05 November 2019,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12291,"ABSTRACTAntitrust regulators play a critical role in protecting market competition. We examine whether the political process affects antitrust reviews of merger transactions. We find that acquirers and targets located in the political districts of powerful U.S. congressional members who serve on committees with antitrust regulatory oversight receive relatively favorable antitrust review outcomes. To establish causality, we use plausibly exogenous shocks to firm–politician links and a falsification test. Additional findings suggest congressional members’ incentives to influence antitrust reviews are affected by three channels: special interests, voter and constituent interests, and ideology. In aggregate, our findings suggest that the political process adversely interferes with the ability of antitrust regulators to provide independent recommendations about anticompetitive mergers."
Disclosure Regulation and Corporate Acquisitions,PIETRO BONETTI,15 January 2020,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12298,"ABSTRACTThis paper examines the effect of disclosure regulation on the takeover market. We study the implementation of a recent European regulation that imposes tighter disclosure requirements regarding the financial and ownership information on public firms. We find a substantial drop in the number of control acquisitions after the implementation of the regulation, a decrease that is concentrated in countries with more dynamic takeover markets. Consistent with the idea that the disclosure requirements increased acquisition costs, we also observe that, under the new disclosure regime, target (acquirer) stock returns around the acquisition announcement are higher (lower), and toeholds are substantially smaller. Overall, our evidence suggests that tighter disclosure requirements can impose significant acquisition costs on bidders and thus slow down takeover activity."
Transparency and Tax Evasion: Evidence from the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA),LISA DE SIMONE,15 November 2019,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12293,"ABSTRACTWe examine how U.S. individuals respond to regulation intended to reduce offshore tax evasion. The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) requires foreign financial institutions to report information to the U.S. government regarding U.S. account holders. We first document an average $7.8 billion to $15.3 billion decrease in equity foreign portfolio investment to the United States from tax-haven countries after FATCA implementation, consistent with a decrease in “round-tripping” investments attributable to U.S. investors’ offshore tax evasion. When testing total worldwide investment out of financial accounts in tax havens post-FATCA, we find an average decline of $56.6 billion to $78.0 billion. We next provide evidence of other important consequences of this regulation, including increased expatriations of U.S. citizens and greater investment in alternative assets not subject to FATCA reporting, such as residential real estate and artwork. Our study contributes to both the academic literature and policy analysis on regulation, tax evasion, and crime."
The Dog that Did Not Bark: Limited Price Efficiency and Strategic Nondisclosure,FRANK S. ZHOU,11 January 2020,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12296,"ABSTRACTTheory posits that investors can rationally infer the implications of strategic nondisclosure for firm value, pressuring managers to disclose information voluntarily. This study documents that the lack of an earnings guidance predicts an abnormal return of −41 basis points around the subsequent quarterly earnings announcement, suggesting that investors do not fully incorporate the implications of nonguidance. Further analyses demonstrate that limitations in price efficiency, driven by investors' limited attention and short-selling constraints, explain the mispricing of nonguidance and are associated with less guidance issuance. Our results collectively highlight limited price efficiency as another friction when studying managers' strategic disclosure decisions."
Detecting Accounting Fraud in Publicly Traded U.S. Firms Using a Machine Learning Approach,YANG BAO,23 November 2019,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12292,"ABSTRACTWe develop a state-of-the-art fraud prediction model using a machine learning approach. We demonstrate the value of combining domain knowledge and machine learning methods in model building. We select our model input based on existing accounting theories, but we differ from prior accounting research by using raw accounting numbers rather than financial ratios. We employ one of the most powerful machine learning methods, ensemble learning, rather than the commonly used method of logistic regression. To assess the performance of fraud prediction models, we introduce a new performance evaluation metric commonly used in ranking problems that is more appropriate for the fraud prediction task. Starting with an identical set of theory-motivated raw accounting numbers, we show that our new fraud prediction model outperforms two benchmark models by a large margin: the Dechow et al. logistic regression model based on financial ratios, and the Cecchini et al. support-vector-machine model with a financial kernel that maps raw accounting numbers into a broader set of ratios."
What Are You Saying? Using topic to Detect Financial Misreporting,NERISSA C. BROWN,03 December 2019,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12294,"ABSTRACTWe use a machine learning technique to assess whether the thematic content of financial statement disclosures (labeledtopic) is incrementally informative in predicting intentional misreporting. Using a Bayesian topic modeling algorithm, we determine and empirically quantify the topic content of a large collection of 10-K narratives spanning 1994 to 2012. We find that the algorithm produces a valid set of semantically meaningful topics that predict financial misreporting, based on samples of Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) enforcement actions (Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Releases [AAERs]) and irregularities identified from financial restatements and 10-K filing amendments. Our out-of-sample tests indicate thattopicsignificantly improves the detection of financial misreporting by as much as 59% when added to models based on commonly used financial and textual style variables. Furthermore, models that incorporatetopicsignificantly outperform traditional models when detecting serious revenue recognition and core expense errors. Taken together, our results suggest that the topics discussed in annual report filings and the attention devoted to each topic are useful signals in detecting financial misreporting."
Strategic Withholding and Imprecision in Asset Measurement,JEREMY BERTOMEU,07 June 2021,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12390,"ABSTRACTDoes managing the production of information add value in economic environments where a manager may claim to be uninformed and withhold unfavorable news? We examine this question by nesting an optimal persuasion mechanism, controlling how evidence is organized, within a voluntary disclosure framework. Information has productive consequences because the firm uses it to make a continuous operating decision. The optimal reporting strategy features coarse information at the most unfavorable reported event if and only if the firm bears penalties for nondisclosure or positive disclosure costs. The model demonstrates the optimality of imprecise information over bad news in a voluntary disclosure environment, and that such imprecision increases the quality of public signals after considering strategic disclosure effects."
Forced Rating Systems from Employee and Supervisor Perspectives,EDDY CARDINAELS,31 May 2021,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12388,"ABSTRACTMany firms use forced rating systems in which supervisors must evaluate employees according to a predefined distribution. We develop new theory suggesting that forced ratings are less likely to enhance performance when supervisors assess subjective dimensions of employee performance (e.g., creativity), but can have some harmful side effects. In a laboratory experiment, employees work on a creative task, and supervisors rate their performance. We do not find any difference in the employees’ performance or effort in a creative task setting between forced and free ratings. We do, however, find that forced ratings create higher stress for employees (ex post stress scales and biomarkers). Higher stress in turn mitigates the positive effect of effort on creativity. Furthermore, we find that actual creativity explains less of supervisors’ ratings of employees’ performance under forced ratings. Instead, factors that are unrelated to actual creativity, such as eloquent writing and strategic gaming behavior, matter more. Results of an additional online experiment confirm that forced ratings work differently in tasks where performance needs to be evaluated subjectively compared to tasks where objective measures are available."
"Talk Less, Learn More: Strategic Disclosure in Response to Managerial Learning from the Options Market",YANGYANG CHEN,26 April 2021,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12368,"ABSTRACTWe examine how options trading affects voluntary corporate disclosure, so that we can shed light on whether managers’ potential learning from the options market induces them to withhold disclosure. We find that options trading reduces the likelihood and frequency of management earnings forecasts, suggesting that firms that have active options trading on their stock make fewer voluntary disclosures. This finding is in accordance with the theoretical prediction that managers strategically reduce disclosure to avoid crowding out informed trading, which can give them informative feedback for their decision making. In support of the managerial learning channel, we document a real effect of reduced disclosure: When managers disclose less, options trading has a stronger positive effect on firm investment efficiency. The more pronounced effect of options trading on management earnings forecasts when the need for managerial learning is higher further supports the learning channel."
Multimarket Contact and Mutual Forbearance in Audit Markets,SIMON DEKEYSER,14 September 2021,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12406,"ABSTRACTCompetition in audit markets is an important topic but direct tests of market competition have been limited. In this paper, we examine how audit firms behave when they are confronted with competition from another firm in a wide range of industry segments in a local market. Sharing a large number of market segments can lead to mutual forbearance among audit rivals. Such mutual forbearance is likely to manifest as higher audit fees in a market because rivals are hesitant to aggressively compete in the face of potential competitive retaliation. Using a sample of 25,662 observations from 2004 to 2015, we find evidence that supports this argument as proxied by the extent that audit firms compete in the same industries in the same locations. This result persists after controlling for several tight fixed-effects specifications based on time, location, industry, and market segments. In supplementary tests, we also find that the likelihood of client switching is negatively associated with the multi-industry contact of the incumbent, but clients that do switch are more likely to choose an alternative audit firm that confronts the predecessor auditor in fewer market segments. Our evidence is consistent with mutual forbearance among rival audit firms when confronted with the same competitor in different market segments."
Cash-for-Information Whistleblower Programs: Effects on Whistleblowing and Consequences for Whistleblowers,AIYESHA DEY,09 May 2021,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12370,"ABSTRACTWe study the effect of financial incentives on whistleblowing and the consequences for whistleblowers under the cash-for-information program of the False Claims Act (FCA). Exploiting appeals-court decisions that increase financial incentives for whistleblowing, we find that greater incentives increase the number of lawsuits filed with the regulator, the regulator's investigation length, the percentage of intervened lawsuits, and the percentage of settled lawsuits. Using information from lawsuits, a professional networking site, and background checks for up to 1,168 whistleblowers, we find that whistleblowers’ long-term annual income decreases by approximately 8.6% or $6,500 but do not find evidence of social costs. In comparison, whistleblowers can expect to receive approximately $140,000 for blowing the whistle. Overall, our results suggest that the FCA cash-for-information program helps expose corporate misconduct and helps compensate whistleblowers for their income loss."
Do Investors Care Who Did the Audit? Evidence from Form AP,MARCUS M. DOXEY,02 July 2021,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12392,"ABSTRACTIn early 2017, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) mandated the disclosure of audit participants, including the lead audit partner and other audit firms participating in the audit (“component auditors”). In this study, we examine whether investors use these disclosures in a way that influences their investment decisions, a primary goal of the PCAOB. Using trading volume, absolute abnormal returns, and bid–ask spreads, we find little evidence of a significant investor response following the disclosure of partner identity or component auditor participation in the first three years of the requirement. We also examine instances where these disclosures are most likely to be informative (e.g., partners associated with restatements or component auditors with PCAOB deficiencies) and find no significant investor response. Taken together, we find little evidence that capital markets respond to partner and component auditor identity in the United States."
The Disciplinary Effect of Social Media: Evidence from Firms' Responses to Glassdoor Reviews,SVENJA DUBE,09 July 2021,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12393,"ABSTRACTWe examine how firms respond to the increased workplace transparency due to the coverage on Glassdoor.com, which collects and disseminates reviews on employee satisfaction. Leveraging the staggered timing of first-time reviews on Glassdoor, we use a difference-in-differences design and find that after being reviewed on Glassdoor, firms improve their workplace practices, measured by corporate social responsibility scores on employee relations and diversity. Consistent with firms improving their workplace practices to remain competitive in the labor market, we find that such improvement concentrates in firms with negative initial reviews and with high labor intensity. We also find firms increase disclosures about workplace practices after being reviewed and the increase concentrates in firms with high institutional ownership, consistent with firms providing more disclosures to appease investors. Overall, our findings suggest that the increased workplace transparency through social media has a disciplinary effect on corporate policies."
Truncating Optimism,ZACHARY KAPLAN,26 July 2021,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12397,"ABSTRACTConsensus estimates, formed by taking an average of analyst forecasts, play an important role in capital markets (e.g., provide investors with a proxy for earnings expectations). We show I/B/E/S, a prominent information intermediary, removes 6% of one-quarter-ahead earnings forecasts before calculating the consensus, and among the 23% of firm-quarters with at least one forecast removed, this figure rises to 16%. We provide evidence suggesting that I/B/E/S subjectively applies policies that govern its removal decisions and accepts feedback from firms that contributes to this subjectivity. Specifically, we find optimistic forecasts are removed more frequently than pessimistic forecasts, and such asymmetry increases further when removals allow firms to meet or beat the consensus. Furthermore, we find that these effects are more pronounced when managers’ incentives to just meet or beat the consensus are stronger (i.e., higher subsequent insider sales or higher compensation delta), or managers have greater ability to influence I/B/E/S. Lastly, we demonstrate that these subjective removals benefit I/B/E/S by improving consensus accuracy, explaining why I/B/E/S is willing to be influenced by firms."
Accrual Accounting and Resource Allocation: A General Equilibrium Analysis,JUNG HO CHOI,29 April 2021,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12365,"ABSTRACTThis paper evaluates the role of accrual accounting in improving firms' production decisions and resource allocation across firms. I introduce two imperfect firm-performance measures, cash flows and accounting earnings, into a general equilibrium model with heterogeneous firms under imperfect information. The model demonstrates that improvements in measurement systems lead to more informed decisions on the part of firms and ultimately to allocation of greater resources to high-productivity firms via the product and input markets. Estimated parameter values are consistent with accrual accounting improving managers' information about current productivity by providing a better measure of historical firm performance. Quantitative analysis suggests that introducing accrual-accounting information on top of cash-accounting information leads to a 0.5% increase in aggregate U.S. productivity and a 0.7% increase in aggregate U.S. output via improved resource allocation. The corresponding estimates for China and India, as benchmarks for developing countries, are larger: a 1.5% to 2.3% increase in aggregate productivity and a 2.3% to 3.4% increase in aggregate output. I conclude that accrual accounting plays a significant role in determining aggregate productivity via improved resource allocation."
Debiasing the Measurement of Conditional Conservatism,MARC BADIA,21 April 2021,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12366,"ABSTRACTBasu's [“The Conservatism Principle and the Asymmetric Timeliness of Earnings.”Journal of Accounting and Economics24 (1997): 3–37] measurement of conditional conservatism as the asymmetric timeliness of earnings underlies hundreds of studies. However, many subsequent studies cast doubt on the extent to which Basu's measure captures conditional conservatism versus statistical biases or alternative constructs (collectively, “biases”), thereby questioning the validity of the inferences that empirical researchers draw from analyses using the measure. We modify Basu's measure in four simple ways to remove these biases. Our key modification is the inclusion of interactive controls for return variance, a volatility proxy that captures Patatoukas and Thomas’ [“More Evidence of Bias in Differential Timeliness Estimates of Conditional Conservatism.”The Accounting Review86 (2011): 1765–1794] return variance effect and various sources of economic optionality and adjustment costs. This inclusion captures volatility-related effects on both thelevelof earnings and thesensitivityof earnings to returns, and it allows the magnitudes of these effects to vary with the sign of returns. We conduct validation analyses using placebo-dependent variables, synthetic returns, and nonconditionally conservative earnings components that show our modified Basu measure is largely free of known biases. We further show that our measure is associated with contracting and other economic variables as predicted by theory. Our findings suggest that researchers can rely on our modified Basu measure to identify the determinants and effects of conditional conservatism."
Copycat Skills and Disclosure Costs: Evidence from Peer Companies’ Digital Footprints,SEAN SHUN CAO,04 May 2021,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12369,"ABSTRACTWe examine whether firms that imitate peer companies’ strategies (copycats) profit from such behavior and how their success may cause competitive harm to disclosing companies. We identify copycat companies by tracking the digital footprints of investment companies that view disclosures on the SEC EDGAR Web site. We find that copycat companies are able to identify profitable trades that outperform other trades disclosed by the copycatted companies by 5.5% annually. Such stock-screening skills are related to investment sophistication and research intensity. Furthermore, copycats inflict greater damage on the performance of disclosing companies when they possess superior copycat skills, when disclosed trading strategies take longer to complete, and when disclosed stock holdings are characterized by high information asymmetry."
Strategic Director Appointments,GEORGE DRYMIOTES,17 February 2021,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12351,"ABSTRACTRecent corporate governance scandals have been attributed to a lack of board independence because of the influence CEOs have over their boards. However, CEOs can also affect board efficacy without compromising its independence by strategically choosing directors. We offer a theoretical framework to examine how CEOs can strategically choose director characteristics (such as expertise and skill set) to influence the inner workings of the board. We examine how director expertise affects the board's equilibrium voting strategies and show that some “passivity” on the part of directors can in fact be desirable equilibrium behavior. More importantly, we show that managers can strategically appoint independent outside directors to influence board voting in their favor. Surprisingly, contrary to what we might expect, we find that opportunistic (principled) managers may not always appoint the least (most) able directors to the board. We also examine whether CEOs would prefer a “captured” board (i.e., an insider-dominated board) and show that the value of director input (i.e., the board's advising role) and the financial markets can discourage CEOs from pursuing such appointments."
Non-Answers During Conference Calls,IAN D. GOW,21 May 2021,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12371,"ABSTRACTWe construct a novel measure of disclosure choice by firms. Our measure is computed using linguistic analysis of conference calls to identify whether a manager's response to an analyst question is a “non-answer.” Using our measure, about 11% of analyst questions elicit non-answers from managers, a rate that is stable over time and similar across industries. A useful feature of our measure is that it enables an examination of disclosure choicewithina call. Analyst questions with a negative tone, greater uncertainty, greater complexity, or requests for greater detail are more likely to trigger non-answers. We find performance-related questions tend to be associated with non-answers, and this association is weaker when performance news is favorable. We also find analyst questions about proprietary information are associated with non-answers, and this association is stronger when firm competition is more intense."
Do Majority-of-Minority Shareholder Voting Rights Reduce Expropriation? Evidence from Related Party Transactions,NAN LI,30 March 2021,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12357,"ABSTRACTIn the presence of business groups, the expropriation through related party transactions (RPTs) is common and costly to minority shareholders. Using the setting of India's RPT voting rule, I find that a majority-of-minority shareholder voting mechanism helps mitigate expropriation. Minority shareholders actively raise their voice against RPT resolutions. A difference-in-differences analysis reveals that shareholder voting has a significant deterrence effect on RPT volume. I also find that stock markets react positively to the voting rule's passage, and that the rule makes Indian firms more attractive to foreign institutional investors."
Analyst Coverage Overlaps and Interfirm Information Spillovers,TIM MARTENS,16 June 2021,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12391,"ABSTRACTWe offer a novel perspective on the role of sell-side analysts as information intermediaries in capital markets by documenting a flow of information in a new direction, namely, from analysts to the firms they cover. We use analyst coverage overlaps and patent citations to examine analyst-induced information spillovers about technology and industry trends. Consistent with analyst coverage–related information flows, firms are more likely to cite another firm's patent if that firm is covered by the same analyst. The effect varies with analysts' specialization, experience, and level of activity. Firms with more analyst-based connections to peers also show greater corporate innovation. Collectively, our evidence indicates that financial analysts not only reduce information asymmetries between firms and capital market participants but also facilitate the production of business intelligence through feedback and interfirm information spillovers."
Economic Downturns and the Informativeness of Management Earnings Forecasts,DAVID A. MASLAR,22 April 2021,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12367,"ABSTRACTEconomic downturns create uncertainty about a firm's operations and make it disproportionately harder for outside market participants to assess the firm's prospects. We posit that in this environment, management earnings forecasts will be more informative to investors and analysts. Consistent with this prediction, we find larger stock price reactions and analyst forecast revisions to news in management forecasts during downturns. Holding the amount of news in forecasts constant, stock price reactions to management forecasts are also greater than those to analyst forecasts. We also find that relative to analyst forecasts, management forecast accuracy increases during downturns, suggesting that investors justifiably assess management forecasts as more informative. Overall, we document that macroeconomic conditions create time-series variation in the informativeness of different sources of information to outside market participants."
Switching from Incurred to Expected Loan Loss Provisioning: Early Evidence,GERMÁN LÓPEZ-ESPINOSA,17 February 2021,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12354,"ABSTRACTThis paper provides early evidence on the effect of global regulation mandating a switch from loan loss provisioning (LLP) based onincurredcredit losses (ICLs) to LLP based onexpectedcredit losses (ECLs). Using a sample of systemically important banks from 74 countries, we find that ECL provisions are more predictive of future bank risk than ICL provisions. Corroborating that the switch to ECL provisioning results in more information to assess bank risk, we also observe that the announcement of a larger first-time impact of the accounting change elicits lower stock returns and higher changes in credit default swap spreads. Critically, these patterns are most pronounced when credit conditions deteriorate. Additional analyses show that the higher information content of the ECL model stems from the provisions for nondefaulted loans, which did not exist under ICL. Our study contributes to the debate on the effect of the ECL model on procyclicality, an especially pressing issue in the context of the current pandemic."
Unrecognized Expected Credit Losses and Bank Share Prices,P. BARRETT WHEELER,17 February 2021,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12353,"ABSTRACTAccounting for credit losses under U.S. GAAP is transitioning from an incurred to an expected loss model. The model change was motivated by concerns that reporting only incurred losses does not provide investors with sufficient and timely information about banks’ credit risk. In this paper, I develop a measure of lifetime expected credit losses using vintage analysis to examine whether stock prices reflect information about unrecognized expected credit losses in an incurred loss regime. Consistent with investors being able to obtain information about expected losses that are not recognized in the financial statements, I find that unrecognized expected credit losses are negatively associated with bank stock prices. The pricing of these losses is stronger for larger banks, consistent with lower costs of obtaining this information for banks with better information environments. I also find that recorded allowances were less than estimated expected losses, on average, consistent with concerns that implementing the expected loss model will adversely impact regulatory capital adequacy."
The Asymmetric Effect of Reporting Flexibility on Priced Risk,MATTHEW J. BLOOMFIELD,21 January 2021,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12346,"AbstractMost firms covary more positively with downmarkets than upmarkets—a phenomenon I refer to as “risk asymmetry.” I predict and find that risk asymmetry is caused, at least in part, by a firm's ability to selectively obfuscate poor performance. Risk asymmetry decreases significantly when firms are required to adhere to the more stringent auditing standards mandated under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, however this decrease is more muted for firms with weak internal controls. Consistent with my predictions, these patterns are stronger for more market-sensitive firms and weaker for firms that include relative performance evaluation in their CEOs' pay packages. Taken together with prior literature (which documents that risk asymmetry is priced), my results suggest that a firm can lower its cost of capital by credibly reducing its ability to obfuscate value-relevant information."
"Short-Term Institutions, Analyst Recommendations, and Mispricing: The Role of Higher Order Beliefs",MARTIJN CREMERS,27 February 2021,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12352,"ABSTRACTWe document that stocks that have optimistic (pessimistic) consensus recommendations and are currently held by many short-term institutions exhibit large stock-return reversals: Their large past outperformance (underperformance) is followed by large negative (positive) future alphas. The predictable return reversals originate from overreaction to past recommendation releases and the correction of these overreactions around future releases. Results are stronger when earnings news is released and at firms with higher fundamental uncertainty. Further, firms with more short-term institutions show stronger announcement returns and price drift after recommendation changes. Our results are consistent with models of higher order beliefs where short-term institutions coordinate trading around public signals."
How Is the Audit Market Affected by Characteristics of the Nonaudit Services Market?,HENRY L. FRIEDMAN,10 February 2021,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12347,"ABSTRACTHow can features of the markets for audit and nonaudit services (NAS) affect an audit firm's incentives to invest in audit quality, average audit quality, and social welfare? We address these questions in a model focusing on competition in both audit and NAS markets. We show that, when audit and NAS demand are positively correlated, prohibiting auditors from providing NAS to audit clients leads to higher investments in audit quality, but can decrease average audit quality if marginal clients switch to lower quality auditors. The effect on social welfare can be positive or negative, depending on the distribution of clients' service demands. General bans on auditor provision of NAS can, via similar channels, increase or decrease audit quality and social welfare. Overall, our findings suggest a more nuanced view of how regulating an auditor's provision of NAS might affect audit quality and social welfare, and are driven by the effects of multimarket competition on the auditor's incentives to invest in audit quality, rather than previously identified auditor independence or knowledge spillover channels."
The Information Role of the Media in Earnings News,NICHOLAS M. GUEST,17 February 2021,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12349,"AbstractI reexamine whether media articles with substantive editorial content inform the market's reaction to firms' earnings news. Using variation in earnings announcement coverage because of restructuring atThe Wall Street Journal(WSJ), my analyses suggest that WSJ earnings articles improve price discovery and increase trading volume at S&P 500 earnings announcements. Additionally, textual analysis suggests media articles that differ more from the firm's earnings release increase trading volume, and that the differences speed up (slow down) price discovery when they corroborate (contradict) the tone of the firm's news. Such high difference articles are slightly longer, are more readable and specific, include more references to the industry and economy, repeat less “stale” news published in previous WSJ articles, and quote more investor and expert sources. Overall, my paper contributes to research on the role of the media in earnings news by providing evidence that journalists' editorial content helps investors understand firms' earnings, instead of simply entertaining or increasing awareness."
Voice of the Customers: Local Trust Culture and Consumer Complaints to the CFPB,RACHEL M. HAYES,21 April 2021,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12364,"ABSTRACTWe use complaints filed with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to study the interplay between social norms and the effectiveness of consumer protection laws. We find that a higher level of trust in a given location is associated with a lower number of complaints filed against financial institutions in that location. Employing a difference-in-differences approach, we further find that, after the establishment of the CFPB, banks in low-trust areas reduce fees charged to consumers more compared to banks in high-trust areas. Our results suggest that the threat of consumer complaints to a government agency affects how banks treat their customers, and they shed light on the interaction between informal culture and formal institutions, as well as on stakeholders’ influence in corporate policies."
Regulation of Compensation and Systemic Risk: Evidence from the UK,ANYA KLEYMENOVA,02 March 2021,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12355,"ABSTRACTThis paper studies the consequences of regulating executive compensation at financial institutions by examining the introduction of the UK Remuneration Code in 2010, which aimed to change the decision-making horizon and risk-taking incentives of bank executives. We find that, although both banks and nonbanks show increased contribution and sensitivity to systemic risk in the United Kingdom post-2010, this increase is lower for UK banks, in line with the intent of the regulation. However, UK banks also experience higher unforced CEO turnover when compared to other UK firms. Therefore, while the regulation may have had the desired effect on systemic risk, it may also have given rise to some unintended consequences."
The Role of Academic Research in SEC Rulemaking: Evidence from Business Roundtable v. SEC,RACHEL GEOFFROY,30 March 2021,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12358,"ABSTRACTTo shed light on the role that academic research plays in Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rulemaking, this paper examines the SEC's patterns of consumption of academic research from 2007 through 2017. We show how theBusiness Roundtable v. SECruling in 2011 increased consideration given to academic research during SEC rulemaking. We find that after the ruling, the SEC cites more papers in its proposed rules and, in particular, more papers that illustrate the costs of regulation. This change in academic citations results in fewer negative comment letters on proposed SEC regulations. We survey academics whose research was cited by the SEC, and the majority respond that the SEC's description of their work is completely or mostly accurate. When we survey general academics, their average rating of the SEC's accuracy is lower, although the rating improves regarding specific SEC quotes citing academic research. Although there is still room for a more substantive discussion of research, having a higher standard of cost-benefit analysis leads to a more balanced discussion of academic research."
Aggressive Boards and CEO Turnover,CYRUS AGHAMOLLA,21 January 2021,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12350,"ABSTRACTThis study investigates a communication game between a CEO and a board of directors where the CEO's career concerns can potentially impede value-increasing informative communication. By adopting a policy of aggressive boards (excessive replacement), shareholders can facilitate communication between the CEO and the board. The results are in contrast to the multitude of models which generally find that management-friendly boards improve communication, and help to explain empirical results concerning CEO turnover. The results also provide the following novel predictions concerning variation in CEO turnover: (1) there is greater CEO turnover in firms or industries where CEO performance is relatively more difficult to assess; (2) the board is more aggressive in their replacement of the CEO in industries or firms where the board's advisory role is more salient; and (3) there is comparatively less CEO turnover in firms or industries where the variance of CEO talent is high."
"Responding to Activist Short Sellers: Allegations, Firm Responses, and Outcomes",Janja Brendel,02 March 2021,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12356,"ABSTRACTThis study provides descriptive evidence on how firms respond to activist short seller reports and how these responses are associated with outcomes for the targeted firms. We show that the frequency of these reports has grown substantially in recent years. Although we find that firms respond only 31% of the time, this rate increases substantially when the report is accompanied by significantly negative abnormal returns and when the report contains new evidence. Not responding is associated with a less negative stock price response at report release and fewer adverse outcomes. Firms that launch internal investigations following the report release have significantly higher subsequent rates of stock exchange delisting and SEC enforcement actions, and lower rates of being acquired. Overall, our results highlight the impact of activist short sellers on target firms and that firm responses are associated with material outcomes."
The Information Externality of Public Firms’ Financial Information in the State-Bond Secondary Market,STEPHANIE F. CHENG,30 March 2021,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12361,"ABSTRACTThis study provides evidence on the role of public firms’ financial reports in the state-bond secondary market. I investigate the informational role of corporate earnings announcements and find that public firms’ monthly earnings signals aggregated to the state level are positively associated with contemporaneous state-bond returns. Further analyses reveal that public firms’ earnings announcements predict traditional economic indicators and contain incremental information that is independent of the traditional economic indicators. In cross-sectional analyses, I show that the earnings–returns relation is especially pronounced when bondholders face longer investment horizons and higher credit risks. Taken together, the evidence indicates a positive externality of corporate financial reports in alleviating the opacity in the municipal bond secondary market."
Anonymous Equity Research,TRAVIS DYER,30 March 2021,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12359,"ABSTRACTCrowdsourced financial information platforms often allow content contributors to publish equity research anonymously. This study examines whether investors value or discount information in anonymous equity research. In the short window around research releases, we find that investors’ stock price reaction to anonymous research is muted in comparison to nonanonymous research. Consistent with credibility concerns influencing investor response, we document that this discount to anonymous research dissipates as the monitoring of content contributors intensifies and as authors develop a reputation for high-quality reporting. In addition, we perform a content analysis on the research reports and find that the muted market reaction to anonymous equity research is robust to controlling for textual attributes of information content, further supporting our inference that investors’ are concerned about the credibility of anonymous equity research."
Show Me the Money! Dividend Policy in Countries with Weak Institutions,ATIF ELLAHIE,30 March 2021,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12363,"ABSTRACTWe hypothesize that, in weak-institution countries, firms adjust the ‘timing’ of dividend payments by committing to distribute a percentage of current earnings as dividends, revealing the extent of firm-level agency conflicts to future investors and facilitating the raising of external capital. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that, on average, firms in weak-institution countries have a higher speed of adjustment (SOA) to their target payout ratio, pay dividends earlier in the life cycle, and are more likely to disclose a dividend policy committing to pay a minimum percentage of earnings. Within-country tests show that, in weak-institution countries, the firms with the highestSOAdividend policies have fewer agency problems and an increased ability to raise external capital. Finally, returns tests around earnings announcements show that high-SOAdividend policies are associated with larger market reactions to earnings in weak-institution countries. Collectively, our findings suggest that dividend policy helps to alleviate agency conflicts in weak-institution countries between firms and (future) investors."
"Less Information, More Comparison, and Better Performance: Evidence from a Field Experiment",HENRY EYRING,30 March 2021,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12362,"ABSTRACTWe use a field experiment in professional sports to compare effects of providing absolute, relative, or both absoluteandrelative measures in performance reports for employees. Although studies have documented that the provision of these types of measures can benefit performance, theory from economic and accounting literature suggests that it may be optimal for firms to direct employees’ attention to some types of measures by omitting others. In line with this theory, we find that relative performance information alone yields the best performance effects in our setting—that is, that a subset of information (relative performance information) dominates the full information set (absolute and relative performance information together) in boosting performance. In cross-sectional and survey-data analyses, we do not find that restricting the number of measures shown per se benefits performance. Rather, we find that restricting the type of measures shown to convey only relative information increases involvement in peer-performance comparison, benefitting performance. Our findings extend research on weighting of and responses to measures in performance reports."
The Firm Next Door: Using Satellite Images to Study Local Information Advantage,JUNG KOO KANG,30 March 2021,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12360,"ABSTRACTWe use novel satellite data that track the number of cars in the parking lots of 92,668 stores for 71 publicly listed U.S. retailers to study the local information advantage of institutional investors. We establish car counts as a timely measure of store-level performance and find that institutional investors adjust their holdings in response to the performance of local stores, and that these trades are profitable on average. These results suggest that local investors have an advantage when processing information about nearby operations. However, some institutional investors do not adjust for thequalityof their local information and continue to rely on local signals even when they are poor predictors of firm performance and returns. This overreliance on poor local information is reduced for institutional investors with greater industry expertise and those with greater incentives to maximize short-term trading profits."
The Effectiveness of White-Collar Crime Enforcement: Evidence from the War on Terror,Trung Nguyen,02 December 2020,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12343,"ABSTRACTThis paper analyzes the impact of changes in regulatory priorities and resource allocation on criminal enforcement of white-collar criminal activities. Using the 9/11 terrorist attacks as a shock to the FBI's priorities and allocation of investigative resources, as well as variation in the Muslim population in the United States, I examine whether prioritization of counterterrorism investigations after 9/11 is associated with weaker enforcement of laws targeting white-collar crime. I then use a difference-in-differences estimation to study the magnitude of any increase in white-collar crime resulting from reduced oversight. I find a significantly greater reduction in white-collar criminal cases referred by FBI field offices that shifted more of their investigative focus away from white-collar crime to counterterrorism. Further, geographic areas in the jurisdictions of FBI field offices with greater shifts in attention from white-collar crime to counterterrorism experienced greater increases in wire fraud, illegal insider-trading activities, and fraud within financial institutions."
How Does Financial-Reporting Regulation Affect Industry-Wide Resource Allocation?,MATTHIAS BREUER,06 January 2021,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12345,"ABSTRACTThis paper examines the impact of mandatory reporting and auditing of firms’ financial statements on industry-wide resource allocation. Using threshold-induced variation in the share of mandated firms in a given industry, I document that reporting mandates facilitate ownership dispersion in capital markets and spur competition in product markets. I, however, do not find that reporting mandates unambiguously improve the efficiency of industry-wide resource allocation. With respect to auditing mandates, I find only that they impose a fixed cost on firms, deterring smaller entrants."
Labor Market Effects of Spatial Licensing Requirements: Evidence from CPA Mobility,STEFANO CASCINO,06 November 2020,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12342,"ABSTRACTWe exploit the staggered introduction of CPA Mobility provisions in the United States to study the effects of spatial licensing requirements on the labor market for accounting professionals. Specifically, we examine whether the removal of licensing-induced geographic barriers affects CPA wages and employment levels, as well as the pricing and quality of professional services. We find that, subsequent to the adoption of CPA Mobility provisions, wages of accounting professionals decrease, whereas employment levels are unaffected. The documented wage effect stems from smaller CPA firms, is more pronounced for CPAs holding senior positions, and persists over time. We also find that service prices decline and that this effect is concentrated in local CPA firms. Moreover, we document that the increased wage and price pressure is not associated with deteriorating service quality. Collectively, our results suggest that the removal of occupational licensing barriers has sizable effects on labor supply and service prices. Our findings inform the current regulatory debate on occupational licensing."
Disclosure Prominence and the Quality of Non-GAAP Earnings,JASON V. CHEN,06 January 2021,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12344,"ABSTRACTThe SEC prohibits the presentation of non-GAAP measures before corresponding GAAP measures; however, a large proportion of non-GAAP reporters present non-GAAP EPS before GAAP EPS in their earnings announcements. This noncompliance raises questions about whether firms use prominence to highlight higher or lower quality non-GAAP information. For firms reporting non-GAAP EPS between 2003 and 2016, prominent non-GAAP EPS is associated with higher quality non-GAAP reporting. Further tests reveal that nonregulatory incentives, rather than regulatory costs, explain this relation. Specifically, prominence is associated with higher quality non-GAAP reporting in settings where prominence is not regulated, investors ignore prominence when non-GAAP reporting quality is lower, and the minority of firms using prominence to mislead exhibit characteristics associated with weaker investor monitoring. Overall, we provide evidence that regulatory noncompliance can reflect an intent to inform, and that most firms use prominence to highlight higher quality non-GAAP information despite prohibitive regulation."
From Implicit to Explicit: The Impact of Disclosure Requirements on Hidden Transaction Costs,CHRISTINE CUNY,25 October 2020,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12340,"ABSTRACTThis paper provides evidence that disclosing corporate bond investors' transaction costs (markups) affects the size of the markups. Until recently, markups were embedded in the reported transaction price and not explicitly disclosed. Without explicit disclosure, investors can estimate their markups using executed transaction prices. However, estimating markups imposes information processing costs on investors, potentially creating information asymmetry between unsophisticated investors and bond-market professionals. We explore changes in markups after bond-market professionals were required to explicitly disclose the markup on certain retail trade confirmations. We find that markups decline for trades that are subject to the disclosure requirement relative to those that are not. The findings are pronounced when constraints on investors' information processing capacity limit their ability to be informed about their markups without explicit disclosure."
Implied Equity Duration: A Measure of Pandemic Shutdown Risk,PATRICIA M. DECHOW,21 January 2021,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12348,"ABSTRACTImplied equity duration was originally developed to analyze the sensitivity of equity prices to discount rate changes. We demonstrate that implied equity duration is also useful for analyzing the sensitivity of equity prices to pandemic shutdowns. Pandemic shutdowns primarily impact short-term cash flows, thus they have a greater impact on low-duration equities. We show that implied equity duration has a strong positive relation to U.S. equity returns and analyst forecast revisions during the onset of the 2020 COVID-19 shutdown. Our analysis also demonstrates that the underperformance of “value” stocks during this period is a rational response to their lower durations."
Do Risk Disclosures Matter When It Counts? Evidence from the Swiss Franc Shock,LUZI HAIL,14 October 2020,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12338,"ABSTRACTWe examine the relation between disclosure quality and information asymmetry among market participants following an exogenous shock to macroeconomic risk. In 2015, the Swiss National Bank abruptly announced that it would abandon the longstanding minimum euro-Swiss franc exchange rate. We find evidence suggesting that firms with more transparent disclosures regarding their foreign exchange risk exposureex anteexhibit significantly lower information asymmetryex post. The information gap in bid-ask spreads appears within 30 minutes of the announcement and persists for two weeks, during which new information gradually substitutes for past disclosures. We validate the information dynamics of past risk disclosures with three field surveys: (1) Sell-side analysts emphasize the importance of existing (risk) disclosures in evaluating the translational and transactional effects of the currency shock. (2) Lending banks’ credit officers rely on past disclosures as the primary information source available for smaller (unlisted) firms in the immediate aftermath of the shock. (3) Investor-relations managers use existing financial filings as a key resource when communicating with external stakeholders. The results suggest that historical disclosures help investors attenuate information asymmetry in light of unexpected news."
Do PCAOB Inspections Improve the Accuracy of Accounting Estimates?,SARAH B. STUBER,24 October 2020,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12339,"ABSTRACTDespite issuing extensive guidance related to the evaluation of accounting estimates, the PCAOB continues to identify deficiencies related to the audit of estimates through their inspections process. We examine whether PCAOB inspections lead to more accurate audited accounting estimates, defined as those that more closely match economic reality, by examining a significant estimate within the banking industry. We find that in contrast with the PCAOB's goal of more accurate and unbiased estimates, allowance for loan losses (ALL) estimates becomelessaccurate and more conservative with higher levels of ALL-related inspection findings for public company audits. We find no evidence of auditor response to PCAOB inspection findings for private-company audits, which arenotsubject to PCAOB inspection. Overall, our findings cast doubt on the efficacy of PCAOB inspections in improving estimate accuracy and suggest that firms are managing inspection risk to the potential detriment of audit quality."
Facilitating Tacit Collusion Through Voluntary Disclosure: Evidence from Common Ownership,ANDREA PAWLICZEK,27 June 2022,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12452,"ABSTRACTWe examine whether voluntary disclosure is associated with incentives for firms to collude. Public disclosure can facilitate collusion by aiding with coordination and monitoring for defections. Using common ownership (investors holding stock in competing firms) to identify reduced incentives to compete, we find a positive association between public disclosure and these incentives. We also find that common ownership is positively associated with measures of disclosure that are likely to facilitate tacit collusion and that this association is stronger in industries where collusion is easier. Our study expands the literature on disclosure and competition among firms by showing that public disclosure is positively associated with incentives for tacit collusion. This finding is consistent with managers facilitating anticompetitive outcomes using voluntary disclosure."
"The Roles of Data Providers and Analysts in the Production, Dissemination, and Pricing of Street Earnings",KHRYSTYNA BOCHKAY,29 July 2022,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12457,"ABSTRACTIn September 2009, Thomson Reuters (TR) discontinued its practice of relying on analysts to determine the treatment of unexpected charges and gains in favor of their immediate exclusion from GAAP earnings. Adopting a difference-in-differences approach, we show that this plausibly exogenous change in TR's methodology resulted in street earnings that are more predictive of future performance; and timelier, more accurate, and less dispersed analyst forecasts of future earnings, consistent with TR enhancing the properties of street earnings and analyst forecasts. Finally, using path analysis we show that a significant portion of TR's effect on price discovery is through its effect on analysts; and that the change in TR's treatment of unexpected items increased (decreased) the relative influence of TR (analysts) on the pricing of street earnings. We conclude that forecast data providers like TR are more than a conduit of information from analysts to investors."
Do Borrowers Intentionally Avoid Covenant Violations? A Reexamination of the Debt Covenant Hypothesis,ADAM BORDEMAN,12 July 2022,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12456,"ABSTRACTIn this study, we replicate and extend the Dichev and Skinner [DS: 2002] study on the debt covenant hypothesis (DCH). We start by replicating DS and find results consistent with theirs. We then extend their work by changing three aspects of the research design: histogram bin width, calculation of slack, and statistical test of discontinuity. We find that the inference from DS is generally robust to varying these choices, although sensitive to different bin widths, during their sample period. We extend our analysis to the period 2000–2019 and find that support for DCH remains robust. We do, however, find a lack of support for DCH when examining the most common financial covenant, debt-to-EBITDA. These findings suggest a more nuanced perspective on DCH, whereby different types of financial covenants provide different incentives and abilities to avoid technical default."
How Do Disclosure Repetition and Interactivity Influence Investors’ Judgments?,NERISSA C. BROWN,29 December 2021,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12420,"ABSTRACTRecent regulatory amendments aimed at modernizing disclosures and enhancing their usefulness focus on repetition and interactivity within firms’ disclosure filings. We use two experiments to provide evidence on the effects of disclosure repetition (repeating of information in the filing) and disclosure interactivity (user involvement in directing the form or content of the information displayed) on investors’ information processing and investment judgments. Results show that repetition increases investors’ processing of repeated information, consistent with the informational role of repetition documented in prior research. In contrast, repetition reduces investors’ processing of other,nonrepeatedinformation when the filing is less interactive. This evidence corroborates concerns that repetition can obscure value-relevant information from investors. However, we find that more interactive disclosures mitigate this harmful effect of repetition on investors’ processing of nonrepeated information. Further, more interactive disclosures lead to deeper overall processing of both repeated and nonrepeated information, rather than more interactive disclosures redirecting investors’ attention and processing away from repeated information. Thus, our evidence suggests that disclosure interactivity is an important disclosure attribute that counteracts the potentially harmful effects of repetition on investors' processing of nonrepeated information, while preserving repetition's informational role."
The Costs of Waiving Audit Adjustments,PREETI CHOUDHARY,05 July 2022,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12453,"ABSTRACTWe analyze the disposition of auditor-proposed adjustments to financial statements. Our analyses address concerns, expressed by regulators and others, that auditors and their clients fixate on quantitative thresholds and overlook qualitative factors in assessing the materiality of discovered misstatements. Using a large sample of Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB)-inspected audits, we examine the frequency with which management records versus waives auditor-proposed adjustments and whether waiving-proposed adjustments ha consequences for reporting reliability and the audit process. We find waived adjustments are linked to lower financial reporting quality measured by material misstatements, to incentives to meet/beat earnings targets, and to the audit process, as measured by higher next-period audit effort and fees and higher next-period proposed adjustments. These effects on the audit process are consistent with auditors responding to the increased risk associated with waived adjustments. In an exploratory analysis, we find that controlling for the amount of proposed adjustments, auditor resignations are negatively associated with waived adjustments."
Relative Performance Evaluation and Competitive Aggressiveness,CHRISTOPH FEICHTER,07 April 2022,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12431,"ABSTRACTWe examine the relation between incentive plans based on relative performance and competitive aggressiveness. Using data on executive incentive-compensation contracts in large U.S. firms, we find a positive association between competitive aggressiveness and peer group overlap—that is, the extent to which two firms select each other as peers in these incentive plans. Our findings indicate that managers of such firms take more frequent as well as more complex competitive actions, relative to managers evaluated on relative performance without peer group overlap. Moreover, we show that these competitive tactics are more pronounced when managers compete against: (1) peers with similar grant sizes, (2) peers on similar performance metrics, and (3) peers in the same industry. Collectively, our findings provide evidence on how widely used incentive-compensation practices relate to strategic firm decisions."
The Relationship Between Non-GAAP Earnings and Aggressive Estimates in Reported GAAP Numbers,RYAN D. GUGGENMOS,27 April 2022,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12434,"ABSTRACTThis study uses a controlled experiment to examine the trade-off between managers’ use of non-GAAP and GAAP earnings to satisfy market expectations and how this relationship can be moderated by both formal and informal regulatory attention to non-GAAP earnings. Our key takeaway is that allowing financial reporting discretion in an alternative disclosure channel, that is, non-GAAP earnings, can reduce firms’ opportunistic GAAP reporting. However, statements by regulators about increased attention to non-GAAP earnings constrain this channel, and this can result in more aggressive GAAP earnings management and reduced GAAP earnings quality. We triangulate these findings with a survey and archival analyses and find results that are consistent with this primary message. Our study provides evidence relevant to standard setters and regulators that non-GAAP measures may serve an important role even if they can be used opportunistically."
Audit Implications of Non-GAAP Reporting,NICHOLAS J. HALLMAN,08 May 2022,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12433,"ABSTRACTWe investigate whether non-GAAP reporting affects the audit process and thereby the quality of the related financial statements. First, we provide evidence that auditors in numerous countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom, rely to varying degrees on non-GAAP profit before tax as a benchmark for determining quantitative materiality. Then, using Premium Listed companies on the London Stock Exchange, we document that U.K. auditor reliance on non-GAAP materiality benchmarks often results in a higher quantitative materiality amount and can lower audit quality. Although U.K. auditors appear skeptical of managers’ more aggressive non-GAAP adjustments, auditors adopt more of management's low-quality adjustments when auditor independence is weaker. In sum, our results suggest that non-GAAP reporting can indirectly affect investors by reducing the rigor of the financial statement audit."
Limited Attention: Implications for Financial Reporting,JINZHI LU,03 April 2022,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12432,"ABSTRACTI develop a theory to study the consequences of providing more detailed information to rationally inattentive investors. I first consider a simple data-provision problem and show that adding more data or detail in financial statements can make it more difficult for investors to extract information. Consequently, investors who have limited information-processing capacity may prefer less detailed information. I also show that when investors' decisions are complements, providing details in addition to a summary may reduce investors' welfare. More specifically, because of increased disclosure of details, a coordination failure could occur in investors' attention-allocation decisions. By showing that adding more detail in financial statements can lead to an information overload problem for investors, this study yields valuable insights for accounting standard setters."
Was Sarbanes–Oxley Costly? Evidence from Optimal Contracting on CEO Compensation,GEORGE-LEVI GAYLE,14 May 2022,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12436,"ABSTRACTThis paper investigates the effects of regulatory interventions on contracting relationships within firms by examining the impacts of the Sarbanes–Oxley (SOX) Act on CEO compensation. Using panel data of the S&P 1500 firms, it quantifies welfare gains from a principal–agent model with hidden information and hidden actions. It finds that SOX: (1) reduced the conflict of interest between shareholders and their CEOs, mainly by reducing shareholder loss from CEOs deviating from their goal of expected value maximization; (2) increased the cost of agency, or the risk premium CEOs are paid to align their interests with those of shareholders; (3) increased administrative costs in the primary sector (which includes utilities and energy) but the effect in the other two broadly defined sectors, services and consumer goods, was more nuanced; and (4) had no effect on the attitude of CEOs toward risk."
Did the Siebel Systems Case Limit the SEC's Ability to Enforce Regulation Fair Disclosure?,KRISTIAN D. ALLEE,16 February 2022,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12423,"ABSTRACTWe examine whether a shock to the enforceability of Regulation Fair Disclosure (Reg FD) limited its ability to restrict the flow of private information between managers and investors. Although prior work provides evidence that Reg FD reduced managers’ selective disclosure of material information immediately following its promulgation, we posit that private information flows returned as a result of the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC's) public enforcement failure inSEC v. Siebel Systems, Inc. Using multiple settings, we find consistent evidence suggesting thatSiebelchanged the cost–benefit tradeoff for Reg FD compliance and effectively reversed the initial effects of the regulation. We also find thatSiebeldisrupted the equilibrium of selective disclosure activity, resulting in anunlevelingeffect among investors with respect to private information advantages. Finally, we find thatSiebelalso had real effects by altering managers’ capital structure decisions. Our findings run counter to the prevailing “mosaic theory” and gradual learning explanations for private information advantages in the extended post–Reg FD period and highlight the importance of enforcement in achieving intended regulatory outcomes."
Boards of a Feather: Homophily in Foreign Director Appointments Around the World,JOHN M. BARRIOS,10 December 2021,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12416,"ABSTRACTWe examine howsimilarityin institutional, legal, and social characteristics between a firm's and its directors’ home countries, that is, country-pair homophily, affects foreign director appointments. We estimate a gravity model that includes economic and geographic proximity and find that country-pair homophily is a significant determinant of foreign director appointments to corporate boards. We also find that country-pair homophily limits the appointments of foreign directors from high-quality governance countries to firms located in low-quality governance countries, which may reduce the role of board internationalization in promoting the global convergence of governance practices. We analyze changes in foreign director appointments around the international adoption of IFRS and Norway's gender-quota rule and find a higher appointment likelihood for directors originating from countries that are institutionally and culturally similar to that of the firm. Our findings point to the critical role that country-pair homophily plays in matching director to boards with implications for the diffusion of governance practices globally."
Did the Dodd–Frank Whistleblower Provision Deter Accounting Fraud?,PHILIP G. BERGER,11 January 2022,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12421,"ABSTRACTWe examine the deterrence effect of the Dodd–Frank whistleblower provision on accounting fraud. To facilitate causal inference, we use state False Claims Acts (FCAs), under which whistleblowing about accounting fraud at a firm invested in by a state's pension fund can result in monetary rewards from that state's government. We divide our sample into firms exposed and not exposed to whistleblowing risk from a state FCA during the 2008–2010 period that preceded the 2011 SEC implementation of the Dodd–Frank whistleblowing provision. We hypothesize that firms already exposed to a state FCA whistleblower law are less affected by the Dodd–Frank whistleblower provision. Using the companies exposed to a state FCA as control firms in our Dodd–Frank tests, the remaining firms constitute the treatment sample. We find that exposure to Dodd–Frank reduces the likelihood of accounting fraud of treatment firms by 12%–22% relative to control firms, but do not find that it affects audit fees."
The Information Content of Corporate Earnings: Evidence from the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,OLIVER BINZ,17 February 2022,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12425,"ABSTRACTWe examine whether the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 increased the information content of corporate earnings disclosures. Prior research questions whether the Act improved disclosure quality but generally relies on long-window tests and yields mixed results. We focus on whether the Act increased earnings informativeness, improving upon prior designs by focusing on short earnings announcement windows and employing a difference-in-differences design to control for potential contemporaneous structural changes. We document an increase in earnings informativeness following the Act, which is larger for treatment firms (which withheld disclosure before the Act) than for control firms. The increase in informativeness is more pronounced for firms that are subject to stronger enforcement."
"Involvement of Component Auditors in Multinational Group Audits: Determinants, Audit Quality, and Audit Fees",ELIZABETH CARSON,24 December 2021,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12418,"ABSTRACTWe study what determines the involvement of component auditors in multinational enterprise (MNE) group audits and the association with audit quality and audit fees. Using unique Australian disclosures of group audit fees paid to the principal and component auditors, we first document that MNE complexity, MNE internationalization, and auditor characteristics are associated with component auditor involvement, and extent and type of component auditor involvement. Next, we find that involvement of component auditors benefits audit quality as long as the principal auditor conducts a substantial amount of work. Once the involvement of component auditors exceeds a certain level, audit quality decreases. We also document that audit fees are higher in the presence of a component auditor and increase with the extent of involvement, irrespective of component auditor type. Our results contribute to the emerging literature on group audits and provide empirical evidence on regulatory concerns about group audit quality."
The Economic Consequences of Financial Audit Regulation in the Charitable Sector,RAPHAEL DUGUAY,15 December 2021,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12417,"ABSTRACTI provide evidence on the effects of financial audit mandates in the charitable sector, in particular their influence on donor behavior. My empirical strategy relies on variation in size-based exemption thresholds across states and differences in size driven by the nature of charities’ activities. Consistent with audit mandates reducing donors’ reliance on charity reputation, I find audit mandates are associated with a lower concentration of donations on the largest, most well-known charities. I show this reallocation of resources allows the charitable sector to serve more diverse geographic areas and social needs. In terms of the effect on willingness to give, I document that audit mandates are associated with a higher proportion of taxpayers who donate. However, I only observe a sizable impact on total contributions in dollars for charities with high inherent information asymmetry. Collectively, these results suggest financial audit regulation reduces information frictions and thereby affects resource allocation in the market for charitable giving."
Real Effects of a Widespread CSR Reporting Mandate: Evidence from the European Union's CSR Directive,PETER FIECHTER,19 February 2022,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12424,"ABSTRACTWe investigate real effects of a widespread corporate social responsibility (CSR) reporting mandate. In 2014, the European Union (EU) passed Directive 2014/95 (hereafter, “CSR Directive”), mandating large listed EU firms to prepare annual nonfinancial reports beginning from fiscal year 2017 onward. We document that firms within the scope of the directive respond by increasing their CSR activities and that they start doing so before the entry-into-force of the directive. These real effects are concentrated in firms that are plausibly more strongly affected by the directive, that is, those with previously low levels of both CSR reporting and CSR activities. Using various alternative outcome variables (e.g., new CSR initiatives, improvements in CSR infrastructure, or firm performance), we show that these real effects reflect meaningful increases in CSR beyond firms’ potential attempts to “greenwash” CSR performance. Finally, we conduct tests that increase our confidence that the documented real effects are attributable to the CSR Directive and not general EU trends in CSR."
"Intangible Investments, Scaling, and the Trend in the Accrual–Cash Flow Association",JEREMIAH GREEN,29 November 2021,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12414,"ABSTRACTWe provide evidence that the documented weakening of the accrual–cash flow association results not from a loss of accrual accounting usefulness per se, but from the deviation from accrual accounting as it relates to intangible investments. More specifically, the weakening of the negative association is driven by the combined effects of (1) increasing intangible investments, (2) the practice of expensing rather than capitalizing intangible investments, and (3) scaling accruals and cash flows by book value of assets, which are understated for intangible-intensive firms. Treating intangible expenditures as capitalized investments and scaling accruals and cash flows by market value of equity, which reflects the value of intangible investments, (1) substantially strengthens the negative association between accruals and cash flows and (2) practically eliminates the apparent weakening trend in the association."
Observing Enforcement: Evidence from Banking,ANYA KLEYMENOVA,19 January 2022,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12422,"ABSTRACTThis paper finds that the disclosure of supervisory actions by bank regulators is associated with changes in their enforcement behavior. Using a novel sample of enforcement decisions and orders (EDOs) and a change in the disclosure regime, we find that regulators issue more EDOs, intervene sooner, and rely more on publicly observable signals following the regime change. EDO documents become longer, more complex, and contain more boilerplate language. Our results also indicate that intervention happens sooner and more frequently in counties with higher news circulation, which suggests that regulators take into account the public perception of their actions. We evaluate potentially confounding factors, including the savings and loan (S&L) crisis and competition from thrifts, and find robust results. We also study bank outcomes and document that uninsured deposits decline at EDO banks in the disclosure regime, especially for those covered in the news. Finally, we observe that bank failure accelerates despite improvements in capital ratios and asset quality. Overall, our research provides new insights on the disclosure of regulatory actions."
Delays in Banks’ Loan Loss Provisioning and Economic Downturns: Evidence from the U.S. Housing Market,SEHWA KIM,16 November 2021,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12415,"ABSTRACTI study whether banks’ loan loss provisioning contributes to economic downturns, by examining the U.S. housing market. Specifically, I examine the aggregate effects of banks’ delayed loan loss recognition (DLR) on house prices during the Great Recession and the channels through which these potential effects arose. I construct ZIP-code-level exposure to banks’ DLR before the crisis and compare high- and low-exposure ZIP codes during the crisis to examine the aggregate effects of banks’ DLR on the housing market. I find that high-exposure ZIP codes experienced larger decreases in mortgage supply, larger increases in distressed sales, and larger decreases in house prices during the crisis. In addition, I conduct individual bank-level analyses and find that high-DLR banks reduced their mortgage supply more than low-DLR banks, and mortgages issued by high-DLR banks were more likely to become distressed during the crisis. Taken together, these findings suggest that banks’ DLR was associated with nontrivial effects on the housing market during the Great Recession, and the effects of DLR on house prices were likely driven by both the credit-crunch and distressed-sales channels."
Do Mandatory Disclosure Requirements for Private Firms Increase the Propensity of Going Public?,CYRUS AGHAMOLLA,21 July 2021,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12396,"ABSTRACTThis paper investigates the effect of mandatory disclosure requirements for private firms on their decision to go public. Using detailed project-level data for biopharmaceutical firms, we explore the effects of a legal reform that exogenously required firms to publicly disclose information regarding clinical trials. Exploiting cross-sectional heterogeneity in firms' exposure to the regulation based on their internal development portfolios, we find that affected firms are significantly more likely to transition to public equity markets following the reform. Moreover, firms that go public because of the increased disclosure requirements subsequently reduce the size of their project portfolios while shifting to safer investments acquired externally. We provide additional evidence for the main hypothesis using a second setting: a 2006 German reform which enhanced the enforcement of mandatory disclosure requirements for private firms. The results suggest that private firms' general information environment and disclosure requirements influence the propensity of going public."
Do U.S. Investors Value Foreign Component Auditors?,BINGYI CHEN,20 November 2021,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12412,"ABSTRACTWe examine whether investors consider foreign component auditors when assessing the value of U.S. multinational corporations (MNCs) using two sets of Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) international regulatory events. We find investors react negatively when the PCAOB is denied access to inspect foreign component auditors in jurisdictions where a U.S. MNC has significant operations and positively when those countries later allow inspection. For foreign component auditors that are inspected, we find investors react positively when they receive clean inspection reports and negatively when they fail to remediate quality control deficiencies. Consistent with PCAOB international oversight providing additional assurance about foreign component auditor quality, our collective results indicate investors consider foreign component auditors when valuing U.S. MNCs."
Auditors Under Fire: The Association Between Audit Errors and the Career Setbacks of Individual Auditors,KEVIN C. W. CHEN,08 August 2021,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12399,"ABSTRACTThis paper examines whether and how individual auditors are disciplined for audit errors. Taking advantage of the long history of auditor identity data from China, we find that signing auditors with client restatements are likely to lose the privilege of signing the audit reports of public clients. However, auditors can avoid this consequence by issuing a modified audit opinion to warn of the potential misstatement. We show that auditors are more likely to be disciplined when their firms operate in less concentrated audit markets. Finally, we find positive outcomes from the disciplinary action of the audit firms. Firms that discipline their auditors for restatements have a larger decrease in the rate of client restatements and a larger increase in market share, compared to nondisciplining firms. Their clients have a higher earnings response coefficient after the disciplinary action. In summary, our results suggest that individual auditors in China can face career setbacks when they produce poor quality audits."
It's a Small World: The Importance of Social Connections with Auditors to Mutual Fund Managers’ Portfolio Decisions,YANGYANG CHEN,21 July 2021,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12395,"ABSTRACTWe find that mutual funds whose managers are socially connected with firm auditors hold more shares of these firms and generate superior portfolio returns. Cross-sectional results reveal that the relation between social connections and mutual fund stockholdings is more pronounced: when the social connections are stronger, when the auditor is in a better position or has stronger incentives to acquire private information, when the fund manager exercises more power, for small audit firms, for auditors in areas with poor investor protection, and for public firms with greater business opacity or private information. Other results are consistent with fund managers electing to schedule their corporate site visits to coincide with the fieldwork of their connected auditors, as would be expected if fund managers time their visits to meet with these auditors to facilitate information transfer. Additionally, we observe associations between fund trading prior to earnings surprises and audit opinions, and the presence of social connections between fund managers and firm auditors. Finally, we show that mutual funds and firms in which they invest tend to appoint connected auditors and pay them higher fees. Collectively, we document empirical patterns that would arise if socially connected auditors and mutual fund managers share information."
How Do Firms Respond to Corporate Taxes?,JEFFREY L. COLES,14 September 2021,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12405,"ABSTRACTUsing a novel empirical approach and newly available administrative data on U.S. tax filings, we estimate the corporate elasticity of taxable income, decompose the elasticity into economic responses versus other tax-motivated “accounting” transactions, and determine how responsiveness varies depending on accounting method, firm size, and interest rate. In response to a 10% increase in the expected marginal tax rate, private U.S. firms decrease taxable income by 9.1%, which indicates a discernibly more elastic response than prevailing estimates. This response reflects a decrease in taxable income of 3.0% arising from real economic responses to a firm's scale of operations and 6.1% arising from accounting transactions via (for example) revenue and expense timing. Responsiveness to the corporate tax rate is more elastic if a firm uses cash (9.9%) rather than accrual accounting (7.4%), if the firm is small (9.9%) rather than large (8.6%), and if the firm discounts future cash flows at a lower rate."
The Long-Term Consequences of Short-Term Incentives,ALEX EDMANS,24 October 2021,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12410,"ABSTRACTThis paper studies the long-term consequences of actions induced by vesting equity, a measure of short-term incentives. Vesting equity is positively associated with the probability of a firm repurchasing shares, the amount of shares repurchased, and the probability of the firm announcing a merger and acquisition (M&A). However, it is also associated with more negative long-term returns over two to three years following repurchases and four years following M&A, as well as future M&A goodwill impairment. These results are inconsistent with CEOs buying underpriced stock or companies to maximize long-run shareholder value, but consistent with these actions being used to boost the short-term stock price and thus equity sale proceeds. CEOs sell their own stock shortly after using company money to buy the firm's stock, also inconsistent with repurchases being motivated by undervaluation."
The Joint Influence of Information Push and Value Relevance on Investor Judgments and Market Efficiency,W. BROOKE ELLIOTT,17 August 2021,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12400,"ABSTRACTWe use experimental markets to examine how pushing investment information and the value relevance of that information interact to influence investors’ value estimate accuracy and market price efficiency. Developments in technology allow information to be pushed to investors anytime and anywhere. However, in addition to value-relevant information, pushed information often includes information that is irrelevant for assessing firm value. Drawing on psychology theory, we find that pushing information has divergent effects depending on the value relevance of the information. Pushing only value-relevant information increases investors’ processing of the information and leads to more accurate value estimates and market prices than when not pushed. In contrast, pushing a mix of value-relevant and value-irrelevant information reduces investors’ processing ofvalue-relevantinformation, leading to less accurate value estimates and market prices due to poorer acquisition and integration of information than when not pushed or when only value-relevant information is pushed. Collectively, our results reveal a dark side to push technologies, particularly with the growing presence of value-irrelevant information."
"Public Firm Presence, Financial Reporting, and the Decline of U.S. Manufacturing",STEPHEN GLAESER,26 November 2021,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12411,"ABSTRACTWe examine the relation between public firm presence and import competition. The information created by public firm presence may provide importers with insights they can use for competing with domestic firms. Consistent with this possibility, we document a positive relation between public firm presence and import competition. We find similar results when using differences in the expected costs of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as a source of plausibly exogenous variation in public firm presence after the act. We use differences in the proportion of German firms reporting publicly around a major enforcement reform as a natural mechanism experiment, and find evidence that financial reporting is a channel through which public firm presence relates to import competition. Additional mechanism tests and a falsification test estimated in the United Kingdom, where public and most private firms report publicly, further support this inference. In total, our evidence is consistent with foreign competitors using the information created by public firm presence, including what public firms disclose in financial reports, to compete with domestic firms. Consequently, our results provide evidence of competitors using the proprietary information disclosed in financial reports to compete with the disclosing firms and of information frictions affecting trade."
Asset-Level Transparency and the (E)valuation of Asset-Backed Securities,JED J. NEILSON,11 June 2021,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12389,"ABSTRACTAs of November 2016, SEC Regulation (“Reg”) AB II requires issuers of certain types of asset-backed securities (“ABS”) to disclose the credit-risk attributes of each asset in the underlying pool, a substantial expansion of prior disclosure requirements. We examine how ABS issuers’ asset-level disclosures under Reg AB II affect the (e)valuation of ABS by investors and credit rating agencies. Using difference-in-differences models that compare affected and unaffected types of ABS, we find that these disclosures improve the ability of initial ABS yields and credit ratings to predict the performance of the underlying assets. These results are concentrated in deals with above-median risk layering in the underlying assets and complexity in the tranching of credit risk. We further find that asset-level disclosures are associated with lower yields. Lastly, we provide evidence that most prospective ABS investors download asset-level information during the price formation period prior to ABS issuance."
Measuring Risk Information,KEVIN C. SMITH,16 November 2021,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12413,"ABSTRACTWe develop a measure of how information events impact investors' expectations of risk. The measure is broadly applicable and simple to implement. We derive it from an option-pricing model, where investors anticipate an announcement that simultaneously conveys information on the announcer's expected future cash flows and risk profile. We empirically implement the measure using firms' earnings announcements, showing that it closely aligns with our model's predictions and offers strong forecasting power for firms' risk profiles, costs of capital, and future investments. We further highlight pitfalls of using simple changes in option-implied volatilities to study information gleaned from earnings announcements. Finally, we apply our measure to study disclosure regulation, the efficacy of text-based proxies, and market-wide events, which we use to illustrate our measure's uses, and illuminate its potential limitations."
Coins for Bombs: The Predictive Ability of On-Chain Transfers for Terrorist Attacks,DAN AMIRAM,23 March 2022,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12430,"ABSTRACTThis study examines whether we can learn from the behavior of blockchain-based transfers to predict the financing of terrorist attacks. We exploit blockchain transaction transparency to map millions of transfers for hundreds of large on-chain service providers. The mapped data set permits us to empirically conduct several analyses. First, we analyze abnormal transfer volume in the vicinity of large-scale highly visible terrorist attacks. We document evidence consistent with heightened activity in coin wallets belonging to unregulated exchanges and mixer services—central to laundering funds between terrorist groups and operatives on the ground. Next, we use forensic accounting techniques to follow the trails of funds associated with the Sri Lanka Easter bombing. Insights from this event corroborate our findings and aid in our construction of a blockchain-based predictive model. Finally, using machine-learning algorithms, we demonstrate that fund trails have predictive power in out-of-sample analysis. Our study is informative to researchers, regulators, and market players in providing methods for detecting the flow of terrorist funds on blockchain-based systems using accounting knowledge and techniques."
Predicting Future Earnings Changes Using Machine Learning and Detailed Financial Data,XI CHEN,12 March 2022,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12429,"ABSTRACTWe use machine learning methods and high-dimensional detailed financial data to predict the direction of one-year-ahead earnings changes. Our models show significant out-of-sample predictive power: the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve ranges from 67.52% to 68.66%, significantly higher than the 50% of a random guess. The annual size-adjusted returns to hedge portfolios formed based on the prediction of our models range from 5.02% to 9.74%. Our models outperform two conventional models that use logistic regressions and small sets of accounting variables, and professional analysts’ forecasts. Analyses suggest that the outperformance relative to the conventional models stems from both nonlinear predictor interactions missed by regressions and the use of more detailed financial data by machine learning."
"Managers’ Body Expansiveness, Investor Perceptions, and Firm Forecast Errors and Valuation",ANTONIO DÁVILA,19 February 2022,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12426,"ABSTRACTWe examine the relation between a measure of managers’ physical display—body expansiveness—and favorable reporting practices (in firm forecasts and valuation information) and performance (survival and funding success). We videotape 154 entrepreneurs pitching their business ideas, and use computer vision software to obtain information about speakers’ movements. We show that physical expansiveness correlates with higher forecast errors and proposed firm valuations and lower survival rates yet higher likelihood of funding success. We argue that investors may incorrectly interpret nonverbal communication in their assessments of entrepreneurs and propose a behavioral explanation. We further corroborate the proposed mechanism by studying investor perceptions of entrepreneurs’ personal characteristics. Overall, we shed light on an overlooked source of information—nonverbal behavior—and relate it to firm forecasting, valuation, survival, and financing success, which are important factors in the assessment of investment opportunities, deal structure, and monitoring."
Leveraging Big Data to Study Information Dissemination of Material Firm Events,BIN LI,21 December 2021,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12419,"ABSTRACTCould real-time big data help unravel material firm events? How would it compare with firm disclosure and traditional media in terms of timeliness and completeness? Could big data provide incremental value-relevant information for investors? With these questions in mind, we use a novel data set of cell phone “pings” (i.e., geolocation signals from mobile devices) to track production disruptions (outages)––material events for U.S. oil refineries. We first validate the construct by examining the effects of outages on local gas prices and firms’ accounting performance. Our main analyses show that (1) refining firms do not voluntarily disclose refinery outages identified by cell phone pings; (2) traditional media cover only a small portion of ping-based outages; (3) the stock market finds ping-based outages to be value relevant but incorporates the information with delay. Further analysis suggests that given the incomplete media coverage and lack of firm disclosure, investors appear to learn the financial impact of such outages through subsequent earnings announcements. Our evidence has implications for regulators such as the U.S. Energy Information Administration and the Securities and Exchange Commission as they continue to evaluate both the compliance and usefulness of disclosures for material firm events such as production disruptions."
Assessing Human Information Processing in Lending Decisions: A Machine Learning Approach,MIAO LIU,15 March 2022,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12427,"ABSTRACTEffective financial reporting requires efficient information processing. This paper studies factors that determine efficient information processing. I exploit a unique small business lending setting where I am able to observe the entire codified demographic and accounting information set that loan officers use to make decisions. I decompose the loan officers’ decisions into a part driven by codified hard information and a part driven by uncodified soft information. I show that a machine learning model substantially outperforms loan officers in processing hard information. Loan officers can only process a sparse set of useful hard information identified by the machine learning model and focus their attention on salient signals such as large jumps in cash flows. However, the loan officers use salient hard information as “red flags” to highlight where to acquire more soft information. This result suggests that salient information is an attention allocation device: It guides humans to allocate their limited cognitive resources to acquire soft information, a task in which humans have an advantage over machines."
"Face Value: Trait Impressions, Performance Characteristics, and Market Outcomes for Financial Analysts",LIN PENG,26 February 2022,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12428,"ABSTRACTUsing machine learning–based algorithms, we measure key impressions about sell-side analysts using their LinkedIn photos. We find that impressions of analysts’ trustworthiness (TRUST) and dominance (DOM) are positively associated with forecast accuracy, especially after recent in-person meetings between analysts and firm managers. HighTRUSTalso enhances stock return sensitivity to forecast revisions, especially for stocks with high institutional ownership. In contrast, the impression of analysts’ attractiveness (ATTRACT) is only positively associated with accuracy for new analysts or when a firm has a new CEO or CFO. Furthermore, while highDOMhelps male analysts’ chances of attaining All-Star status, it reduces female analysts’ accuracy and the likelihood of winning the All-Star award. In addition, the relation betweenTRUSTand accuracy is modulated by the disclosure environment and is attenuated by Regulation Fair Disclosure. Our results suggest that face impressions influence analysts’ access to information and the perceived credibility of their reports."
The Role of Disclosure and Information Intermediaries in an Unregulated Capital Market: Evidence from Initial Coin Offerings,THOMAS BOURVEAU,12 September 2021,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12404,"ABSTRACTUsing an international sample of 2,113 initial coin offerings (ICOs), we explore the role of disclosure and information intermediaries in the unregulated crypto-tokens market. First, we document substantial cross-sectional variation in the voluntary disclosure practices of ventures seeking to raise capital through ICOs, such as the extent of information released in a prospectus-type document called a white paper; releasing the technical source code; and communicating through social media platforms. Second, we find that, even with limited disclosure verifiability, ventures with higher levels of disclosure have a greater ability to raise capital. Finally, we find that this association is stronger in the presence of mechanisms that lend credibility to ventures’ voluntary disclosures, such as internal governance practices or external scrutiny from information intermediaries. Overall, our results suggest that voluntary disclosure and information intermediaries facilitate the functioning of ICOs as an alternative capital market."
How is Earnings News Transmitted to Stock Prices?,Vincent Grégoire,29 July 2021,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12394,"ABSTRACTWe examine the speed and mechanism of the price discovery process following earnings announcements in the after-hours market, a very illiquid trading environment. Prices reflect earnings surprises mostly through changes in quotes rather than through trades. Following positive announcement surprises, ask prices adjust quickly while bid prices are slower to adjust, and vice versa for negative surprises. Returns computed from trade prices underestimate the speed and magnitude of price reactions following announcements relative to returns computed from quotes. These findings emphasize the importance of using quotes and not trade prices when examining intraday price discovery. Because firm announcements such as earnings generally occur in the after-hours market, using quotes is crucial as trading is sparse. We further illustrate the importance of quotes when examining the price discovery process around analyst recommendation revisions."
Reciprocity in Corporate Tax Compliance—Evidence from Ozone Pollution,TRAVIS CHOW,26 July 2023,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12500,"ABSTRACTIn a tax—public goods reciprocity framework between citizens and the state, managers view taxes as a payment to the government in exchange for public goods, and hence they adjust their willingness to pay taxes as public good quality changes. We show that corporate tax planning intensity increases with ground-level ozone pollution. Revisions in ozone pollution regulations cause counties that failed the revised and more stringent standards to reduce ozone pollution. Consequently, firms headquartered in these counties reduced corporate tax planning intensity relative to firms in other counties. The ozone-tax link varies in the predicted directions with public attention to pollution, potential welfare loss due to ozone, managers’ stakeholder orientation, taxpayers’ polluting status, political preferences, and civic norms. We also find consistent results for Superfund cleanups of hazardous waste sites. Our research sheds light on reciprocity as a potential mechanism influencing corporate tax compliance."
Did the FASB Codification Reduce the Complexity of Applying U.S. GAAP?,Oliver Binz,27 March 2023,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12480,"ABSTRACTWe examine whether the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Codification made it easier for preparers and auditors to locate relevant accounting guidance. We find that areas of U.S. GAAP with more dispersed and voluminous guidance before the Codification experience a larger post-Codification reduction in restatements. We find a similar decline in SEC comment letter questions referencing areas of U.S. GAAP with more dispersed and voluminous pre-Codification guidance. Our results suggest that before the Codification, preparers and auditors had difficulty in locating the appropriate accounting guidance and that the Codification mitigated this difficulty."
Externalities of Financial Statement Fraud on the Incoming Accounting Labor Force,ROBERT R. CARNES,04 August 2023,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12501,"ABSTRACTFinancial statement fraud generates many negative effects, including reducing people's willingness to participate in the stock market. If it also stigmatizes accounting, it may similarly adversely affect the quantity and quality of workers willing to become accountants, thereby potentially creating negative effects for years to come. We examine the impact of fraud on the labor force entering the accounting profession, which is a key input into the production of accounting information (i.e., the output). Using data describing millions of college students across the United States, we find incoming students are actually more likely to major in accounting when local frauds occur during their formative years. These students are also more likely to have attributes desired by the accounting profession (e.g., high academic aptitude) and are more likely to subsequently serve in public accounting and become Certified Public Accountants. In the context of other fields (i.e., all college majors), we find that fraud similarly spurs interest in other business disciplines, but not in majors outside of business schools. Those attracted to other business disciplines, however, generally possess different traits. Specifically, students entering accounting are distinctively more likely to exhibit values espoused by the accounting profession, including a predisposition to public service and less commercial orientation. Thus, nonpecuniary motives appear to uniquely drive accounting student enrollment following fraud. Collectively, our findings suggest that, while fraud is unmistakably bad, it appears to have the positive unintended consequence of attracting labor into business disciplines and, in accounting, increasing the prevalence of desirable traits among entrants."
Ethnic Minority Analysts’ Participation in Public Earnings Conference Calls,RACHEL W. FLAM,08 August 2023,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12504,"ABSTRACTWe investigate ethnic minority and nonminority sell-side analysts’ participation in public earnings conference calls. We find that minority analysts are underrepresented in conference call Q&A sessions, and minority analysts who do participate on the calls experience lower levels of prioritization than do nonminority analysts. Minority analysts’ lower participation rates are partially but not fully mediated by characteristics such as experience, work environment, and stock rating favorability. Additionally, firm and conference call fixed effects mediate approximately half the magnitude of lower minority participation rates. Extroverted minority analysts participate at higher rates, but the negative association between minority status and conference call participation is exacerbated when calls are more time constrained, when executive teams are less diverse, and when analysts are from less prestigious brokerage houses. Overall, we document the underrepresentation of minority analysts on earnings conference calls and provide evidence suggesting both analysts’ and managers’ choices influence minority analysts’ participation rates."
"Out of Site, Out of Mind? The Role of the Government-Appointed Corporate Monitor",LINDSEY A. GALLO,09 August 2023,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12502,"ABSTRACTWe study the role of a relatively new type of external firm monitor, an on-site government-appointed Corporate Monitor, and assess whether such appointments reduce firms' propensity to violate laws. Using a sample of deferred and nonprosecution agreements, we first document the determinants of Monitor appointment. We find firms that voluntarily disclose wrongdoing and have more independent directors are less likely to have Corporate Monitors, whereas those with more severe infractions, mandated board changes, and increased cooperation requirements are more likely to have Monitors. We find such appointments are associated with an 18%–25% reduction in violations while the Monitor is on site, however, the effect does not persist after the Monitorship ends. Using a semisupervised machine learning method to measure changes in firms' ethics and compliance norms, we find that the reduction in violations is associated with changes in ethics and compliance that also do not persist. Finally, we document that firms under Monitorship experience a persistent reduction in innovation, highlighting a previously unexplored cost of these interventions. Overall, our results suggest that, although Corporate Monitors on site are associated with fewer violations, firms revert to previous levels of violations following Monitors' departure."
The Real Effects of Modern Information Technologies: Evidence from the EDGAR Implementation,ITAY GOLDSTEIN,08 June 2023,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12496,"ABSTRACTUsing the implementation of the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR) system from 1993 to 1996 as a shock to information dissemination technologies, we examine how a significant reduction in disclosure processing costs affects the real economy. We find that the EDGAR implementation leads to an increase in corporate investment and that this effect is concentrated in value firms. We provide evidence that improved equity financing and enhanced managerial incentives are likely the underlying mechanisms. Specifically, the EDGAR implementation leads to an increase in a firm's stock liquidity, a decrease in the cost of equity capital, and an increase in the level of equity financing. Consistent with the monitoring effect of broad information dissemination, the EDGAR implementation leads to an increase in a firm's operating performance. Our findings suggest that it is important to consider information dissemination beyond information production when examining the real effects of corporate disclosures."
Do Governments Hide Resources from Unions? The Influence of Public Sector Unions on Reported Discretionary Fund Balance Ratios,ANGELA K. GORE,21 June 2023,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12497,"ABSTRACTWe explore whether municipalities with public sector unions exploit aspects of governmental (or “fund”) accounting to obscure the availability of discretionary resources in fund balance accounts, relative to municipalities without public sector unions. We first investigate whether governments with unions report higher proportions of discretionary resourcesoutsideof the general fund, a primary measure of financial health, and instead within less prominent fund types. Second, we explore whether governments with unions report lower ratios within accessible general fund balance account categories – that is, report lower proportions of unreserved fund balance. Primary findings are consistent with both hypotheses. Although somewhat mixed, cross-sectional analyses reveal that effects are magnified when unions have more bargaining power, as proxied by the ability to strike or the absence of state right-to-work laws. Further analysis corroborates cross-sectional findings by examining difference-in-differences specifications surrounding the quasi-exogenous shock of Wisconsin's 2011 weakening of state public sector union laws and Ohio's time-varying union contract negotiations. Overall, the evidence suggests that governments with unions shelter resources to avoid the appearance of large discretionary amounts available."
The Effect of Client Industry Agglomerations on Auditor Industry Specialization,W. ROBERT KNECHEL,09 August 2023,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12503,"ABSTRACTPrior research on auditor industry specialization documents fee premiums for local audit offices that are industry specialists. This research assumes that the effects of specialization are uniform across markets. We examine industry specialization based on the economic theory of industry agglomeration (geographic areas with high industry concentration). Agglomeration economies can facilitate access to knowledge for auditors serving a specific industry in those locations. We find that industry specialists in agglomerations earn a fee premium in excess of specialists in other markets. We find that nonspecialist offices in agglomerations also earn fee premiums in that industry when compared to nonspecialists in other markets even when controlling for these groups’ absolute share of the national market. We also address whether or not this expertise can be shared among offices in an agglomeration specialist's firm. We find that audit offices that have easy connections to a within-firm office in an agglomerated market can earn a fee premium relative to more distant offices, suggesting a benefit from knowledge transfer. This fee premium accrues to offices that would not be considered a specialist using traditional market share measures in a given industry. These findings indicate that the benefit of industry specialization depends on more than local market share."
Economic Consequences of Transparency Regulation: Evidence from Bank Mortgage Lending,ALLISON NICOLETTI,23 June 2023,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12498,"ABSTRACTWe examine the economic consequences of a rule designed to improve consumers' understanding of mortgage information. The 2015 TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosures rule (TRID) simplifies the mortgage disclosures provided to consumers. As a consequence, TRID-affected mortgages become a less attractive investment opportunity to banks. Our main results document that mortgage applications affected by TRID are less likely to be approved following the rule's effective date. We find evidence consistent with both a decrease in consumers' information processing costs and an increase in banks' secondary market frictions, providing insight into the potential channels through which this reduction in mortgage credit operates. We also find that banks partially compensate for reduced mortgage lending by increasing small business lending, and that fintechs absorb mortgage demand in areas with reduced mortgage lending by banks. Our study documents real actions that firms take in response to disclosure transparency regulation and contributes to the literature on the economic consequences of such regulation."
Beyond Performance: Does Assessed Potential Matter to Employees’ Voluntary Departure Decisions?,CAROLYN DELLER,08 March 2023,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12476,"ABSTRACTFirms are increasingly implementing performance–potential assessment systems, whereby supervisors evaluate employees’ current performance and future-oriented potential (i.e., promotion prospects). Whether retention is greatest for high performance–high potential (HiPo) employees under such a system is an empirical question—while the “promise” of a promotion may aid retention, these employees likely face attractive outside options. Using data from a multinational firm, I find that HiPos generally depart at a lower rate thanlower performingnon-HiPos. Among shorter tenured employees, I find the strongest evidence that potential matters to departures, above and beyond performance. In several instances, the rate of departure is lower when assessed potential is higher, holding performance constant. This is the case both among higher performers, where high potential leads to HiPo status, and among lower performers where high potential affords no such status. My findings suggest that HiPo status and potential ratings may help in facilitating employees’ early sorting decisions."
How Do Firms Respond to Political Uncertainty? Evidence from U.S. Gubernatorial Elections,ANDREW BIRD,27 March 2023,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12482,"ABSTRACTWe examine the joint response to political uncertainty along two margins: changes in real activity and voluntary disclosure. We focus on within-firm variation in exposure to ex ante competitive U.S. gubernatorial elections using data on preelection poll margins and firms’ state exposures. Despite real activity falling in the years leading up to a close election, we find that voluntary disclosure increases both in frequency and content, including mentions of risk in filings that reference states holding elections. Our tests use a decomposition of 8-K filings into real activity and voluntary disclosure to address the endogenous complementarity between these two responses. These results hold when using alternative ex ante measures of political uncertainty based on term-limited incumbents, historically competitive offices, or state legislature gridlock. Both effects of political uncertainty are stronger for firms in highly regulated industries and weaker for those least exposed to the local market, linking the real activity and disclosure responses to uncertainty."
Flu Fallout: Information Production Constraints and Corporate Disclosure,CHEN CHEN,02 May 2023,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12486,"ABSTRACTUsing influenza epidemic data, we examine how constraints on corporate information production affect disclosure policies. We find that firms in areas with higher flu activity are less likely to issue short-run earnings forecasts and more likely to issue long-run earnings forecasts. These results are more pronounced when the information production process is more complex, when managers face a greater reputational loss for issuing low-quality short-run forecasts, and when firms’ costs of switching the forecast horizon are lower. Further analysis implies that the effect of flu activity on these forecast issuance decisions is not driven by firm performance or information uncertainty. Our results suggest that managers do not simply avoid issuing forecasts in response to information production constraints. Instead, they shift the forecast horizon from short-run to long-run, appearing to balance the costs of issuing low-quality forecasts with those of not issuing forecasts at all."
Financial Reporting Quality and Wage Differentials: Evidence from Worker-Level Data,JUNG HO CHOI,18 March 2023,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12477,"ABSTRACTWe examine whether financial reporting quality affects worker wages using employer-employee matched data in the United States. We find that low financial reporting quality is associated with a compensating wage differential—that is, a risk premium—using three distinct approaches while controlling for worker characteristics by (1) regressing wages on firm-year–level and firm-level reporting quality, (2) documenting wage changes when workers switch firms, and (3) estimating a structural approach that separates reporting quality from performance-related volatility. We find evidence consistent with two channels: performance pay and turnover risk, where workers bear risks from noise in performance measurement and unemployment, respectively. To mitigate endogeneity concerns, we show that—after the accounting scandals in 2002 and after the announcements of an internal control weakness (ICW)—former Arthur Andersen clients and ICW firms pay wage premiums to employees, with magnitudes between 0.9% and 2.8% of annual wages."
The Impact of Open Data on Public Procurement,RAPHAEL DUGUAY,04 April 2023,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12479,"ABSTRACTWe examine how open procurement data affect the competitiveness of award procedures and the execution of government contracts. The European Union recently made its historical procurement notices available for bulk download in a cohesive and user-friendly database. Comparing government contracts above and below EU procurement size thresholds, we find that, after the open data initiative, procurement officials are more likely to award treated contracts through open bidding. In cross-sectional analyses, we document variation in the open bidding effect consistent with two underlying mechanisms: (1) increased scrutiny by NGOs and investigative journalists and (2) learning by national procurement regulators. However, treated contracts are also more likely to experience costly modifications because the shift to open bidding introduces rigidity that limits officials’ discretion in selecting suppliers based on private information. Overall, our evidence indicates that open procurement data promote competitive bidding but lead to contracts with weaker execution performance. These inferences also hold in an alternative open data setting."
Gaming the IRS’ Third-Party Reporting System: Evidence from Pari-Mutuel Wagering,DUKE FERGUSON,06 April 2023,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12483,"ABSTRACTThis study examines whether taxpayers intentionally avoid Internal Revenue Service (IRS) third-party reports. In 2017 an IRS amendment created a quasi-exogenous shock that reduced third-party tax reporting of pari-mutuel gambling winnings from certain types of wagers. I consider the effect that this rule change had on taxpayer behavior. Using a difference-in-differences research design comparing thoroughbred racing in the United States to Canada, I find a 27% increase in gambler's investment into wager-types that became less likely to trigger third-party reports. Further, I provide evidence that this effect was because of third-party reporting, not withholding, and was stronger in more informed gambling populations. These findings suggest that taxpayers knowingly avoid third-party reports, enabling underreporting of income to the IRS. This has important policy implications because underreported individual income is the largest driver of the $496 billion annual gap between legal tax liability and actual tax collections in the United States."
Does Public Firms’ Mandatory IFRS Reporting Crowd Out Private Firms’ Capital Investment?,JIANCHENG (DUNCAN) LIU,26 May 2023,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12494,"ABSTRACTWe investigate how the mandatory adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) by publicly listed firms in the European Union affects peer private firms. We find that private firms’ capital investment decreases significantly after the IFRS mandate, relative to public firms. Private firms also display decreased investment when benchmarked against firms relatively insulated from the impact of the IFRS mandate, but the magnitude of the effect is smaller in this case. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that mandatory IFRS reporting (combined with other reforms), while increasing public firms’ financing and investment, crowds out funding for private firms. The effect is more pronounced for larger private firms and in industries where public peers have greater external financing needs. Our evidence suggests that financial reporting regulations cause shifts in resource allocation in an economy."
Private Equity and Local Public Finances,MARCEL OLBERT,11 May 2023,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12487,"ABSTRACTWe study the economic impact of private equity (PE) investments on local governments, which are important corporate stakeholders. Examining over 11,000 deals and private firm data in Europe, we document that target firms' effective tax rates and total tax expenses decrease by 15% and 13% after PE deals. At the same time, target firms expand their capital expenditures and firm boundaries, but do not increase employment. Using administrative data on the public finances of German municipalities and exploiting the geographical and time-series variation in PE deals, we document that PE activity is negatively associated with local governments' tax revenues and spending. This result is likely driven by reduced tax payments of PE portfolio firms, accompanied by only modest positive spillovers of PE investments on regional economic growth. Collectively, our findings suggest that corporate tax efficiency serves as a cost-cutting channel in the PE sector and constrains the finances of local governments."
Auditors’ Use of In-House Specialists,ALEKSANDRA “ALLY” B. ZIMMERMAN,23 April 2023,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12485,"ABSTRACTUsing Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) inspection data from 2006 to 2018, we examine the use of auditor-employed specialists in audit engagements. First, we find that the use of specialists is increasingly prevalent and related to clients’ size and complex accounting estimates. Second, the use of specialists is positively associated with the incidence of audit process deficiencies (identified by PCAOB inspections) but is not associated with output-based audit-quality proxies (restatements or absolute discretionary accruals). Hence, although process deficiencies are more likely to occur in engagements with higher use of specialists, financial reporting quality is not negatively impacted. Third, the use of specialists is positively associated with the likelihood of goodwill impairments and negatively associated with engagement profitability. Finally, cross-sectional tests suggest that board accounting expertise is a salient condition for more effective use of specialists. Collectively, our findings align with concerns noted by the PCAOB and prior experimental and survey studies. Although specialists assist auditors with the audit of complex estimates, engagements with comparatively high specialist use entail an incremental risk of audit process deficiencies."
Do Jobseekers Value Diversity Information? Evidence from a Field Experiment and Human Capital Disclosures,JUNG HO CHOI,03 February 2023,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12474,"ABSTRACTWe examine how information about the diversity of a potential employer's workforce affects individuals’ job-seeking behavior. We embed a field experiment in job recommendation emails from a leading career advice agency in the United States. The experimental treatment involves highlighting a diversity metric to jobseekers. Our results indicate that disclosing diversity scores in job postings leads jobseekers to click on firms with higher diversity scores, with such effects varying across jobseeker demographics. A follow-up survey provides evidence on potential explanations for why jobseekers value diversity information. We then examine how jobseekers’ preferences for diversity relate to disclosure choices under the U.S. SEC Human Capital Disclosure requirement. We find that firms in industries characterized by higher jobseeker responsiveness to diversity information tend to voluntarily disclose diversity metrics in their 10-Ks under these new disclosure requirements."
Racial Diversity Exposure and Firm Responses Following the Murder of George Floyd,KARTHIK BALAKRISHNAN,13 April 2023,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12484,"ABSTRACTGeorge Floyd's murder caused many firms to reveal how exposed they are to racial diversity issues. We examine investor and firm behaviors after this socially significant event to provide evidence on the valuation effects of the exposure and ensuing corporate responses. We develop a text-based measure of a firm's exposure to racial diversity issues from conference call transcripts and find that, after the murder of George Floyd, firms with diversity exposure experience a stock price decrease of approximately 0.7% around the date of the conference call. We provide evidence that this effect is attributable to race-related exposure and not gender-related exposure. Initiatives taken by firms mitigate the negative market reaction. We document that firms with racial diversity exposure respond by appointing Black directors. The stock market views appointments of Black directors more favorably after George Floyd's murder, except when they are perceived as symbolic. We also find that firms with greater exposure to racial diversity are more likely to establish diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) departments, appoint DEI leaders, specify diversity goals, increase supply chain diversity, and donate to racial justice causes. Our paper provides evidence that exposure to racial diversity issues adversely affects firm value, and companies address the exposure by taking actions."
Executive Compensation Tied to ESG Performance: International Evidence,SHIRA COHEN,30 March 2023,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12481,"ABSTRACTUsing a wide sample of international publicly traded firms, this paper studies the rapidly increasing practice of incorporating Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) metrics in executive compensation contracts. Our evidence suggests that this compensation practice varies at the country, industry, and firm levels in ways that are consistent with efficient incentive contracting. We also observe that reliance on ESG metrics in executive compensation arrangements is associated with engagement, voting, and trading by institutional investors, which suggests that firms could be adopting this practice to align their management's objectives with the preferences of certain shareholder groups. Finally, we find that the adoption of ESG Pay is accompanied by improvements in key ESG outcomes, but not by improvements in financial performance."
Assessing the Social Impact of Corporations: Evidence from Management Control Interventions in the Supply Chain to Increase Worker Wages,GREGORY DISTELHORST,08 February 2023,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12472,"ABSTRACTThis study examines an initiative by a large multinational garment retailer (H&M Group) to increase wages at its supplier factories by intervening in their wage-related management practices. Difference-in-differences estimates based on eight years of data from over 1,800 factories show that the interventions were associated with an average real wage increase of approximately 5% by the third year of implementation. Our estimates suggest that the intervention-associated wage increase was many times greater than if the retailer's cost for the program was instead paid directly to affected workers. We find that the wage effects were driven by factories with relatively poorer supplier ratings and do not find significantly different wage effects depending on the presence of trade unions. We also examine several nonwage outcomes such as factory orders, supplier price competitiveness, overtime pay, and total employment to probe the mechanisms underlying the wage increases. These findings offer new evidence on corporate social impact in global supply chains."
The Effect of Firms' Information Exposure on Safeguarding Employee Health: Evidence from COVID-19,LISA YAO LIU,23 January 2023,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12471,"ABSTRACTWe show that information exposure through international business networks enables firms to take proactive measures that benefit employees and potentially the local community. Specifically, in the early days of COVID-19, firms that have business networks with China and Italy are more likely to be aware of the severity of the disease, and proactively implement work-from-home (“WFH”) policies that can protect their employees. Using Safegraph foot traffic data, we find a higher stay-at-home ratio before local governments impose lockdowns in zip codes where firms have a larger information exposure. These areas are also associated with a lower spread of COVID-19. Our main findings are more pronounced when local governments face constraints in quickly responding to COVID-19 and when firms have a higher WFH capability or have more investors with socially responsible preferences. Collectively, we present evidence on the role of private corporations in mitigating the negative effects of a public health crisis before government intervention."
Transmission Effects of ESG Disclosure Regulations Through Bank Lending Networks,LYNN LINGHUAN WANG,26 March 2023,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12478,"ABSTRACTThis paper studies whether and how environmental, social, and governance (ESG) disclosure regulations imposed on banks generate transmission effects along the lending channel. I use a setting of U.S. firms borrowing from non-U.S. banks and exploit the staggered adoption of ESG disclosure regulations in banks’ home countries. I find that exposed borrowers of affected banks improve their environmental and social (E&S) performance following the disclosure mandate. Consistent with banks enhancing both their engagement and selection activities, affected banks impose more environmental action covenants in loan contracts, and they are more likely to terminate a borrower with bad E&S records following the regulation. Further evidence shows that the transmission effects are stronger when a disclosure regulation is well-enforced (as indicated by a greater increase in banks’ disclosure) and among borrowers with greater switching costs. Collectively, the findings document the role of lending relationships in transmitting the real effect of ESG disclosure regulations from banks to borrowing firms."
Greenhouse Gas Disclosure and Emissions Benchmarking,SORABH TOMAR,02 February 2023,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12473,"ABSTRACTI examine the effects of the U.S. Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Reporting Program, which requires thousands of industrial facilities to measure and report their GHG emissions. I show that facilities reduce their GHG emissions by 7.9% following the disclosure of emissions data. The evidence indicates that benchmarking—whereby facilities use the disclosures of their peers to assess their own relative GHG performance—spurs emission reductions. Firms' concerns about future legislation appear to motivate this behavior and measurement alone (without disclosure) seems not to reduce emissions. My study highlights how mandatory GHG disclosure can create real effects for peers."
Promote Internally or Hire Externally? The Role of Gift Exchange and Performance Measurement Precision,ERIC W. CHAN,06 February 2023,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12475,"ABSTRACTManagers often face the choice between promoting an internal employee and hiring an external candidate. Using an interactive experiment, we examine the drivers of managers’ promote/hire decisions and internal employees’ behavior before and after those decisions. Consistent with gift exchange theory, we find that employees exert costly effort to increase the chance of being promoted, and they raise their effort level as the promote/hire decision becomes imminent. Managers respond by promoting those who exert high effort, despite employees’ inferior ability compared to external candidates. Results suggest that managers view employees’ past effort as both a gift to reciprocate and a signal of their future effort. Moreover, we find that managers are more likely to promote internally rather than hire externally under a less precise performance measurement system, and this result is driven by managers who observe low employee output. Finally, we find that total effort is significantly higher when managers promote internally versus hire externally."
Standard Error Biases When Using Generated Regressors in Accounting Research,WEI CHEN,26 December 2022,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12470,"ABSTRACTWe analyze the standard error bias associated with the use of generated regressors—independent variables generated from first-step regressions—in accounting research settings. Under general conditions, generated regressors do not affect the consistency of coefficient estimates. However, commonly used generated regressors can cause standard errors to be understated. Problematic generated regressors include predicted values, coefficient estimates, and measures derived from these estimates. Widely used generated regressors in accounting include measures of earnings persistence, normal accruals, litigation risk, and conditional conservatism. Using simple regression models and simulation, we demonstrate how generated regressors can produce understated standard errors in accounting research settings. We also demonstrate how the magnitude of the standard error bias is inversely related to the precision of the generated regressor. Finally, we discuss bootstrapping as a correction for the bias and demonstrate the pairs cluster bootstrap as a tool to improve inferences in common accounting settings involving generated regressors."
Financial Reporting and Employee Job Search,ED deHAAN,02 January 2023,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12469,"ABSTRACTWe investigate the effects of financial reporting on current employee job search, that is, whether firms' public financial reports cause their employees to reevaluate their jobs and consider leaving. We develop theory for why current employees use earnings announcements (EAs) to inform job search decisions, and empirically investigate job search based on employees' activity on a popular job market website. We find that job search by current employees increases significantly during EA weeks, especially when employees are more mobile and when their information frictions are greater. We also find that employees use EAs to update their expectations about their employers' economic prospects, consistent with learning, and some evidence that positive announcements elicit less search. Our paper contributes to the burgeoning labor and accounting literature by providing among the first evidence closely linking financial reports to employee learning and job search."
Balanced Scorecards: A Relational Contract Approach,OLA KVALØY,19 October 2022,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12465,"ABSTRACTReward systems based on balanced scorecards often connect pay to an index, that is, a weighted sum of multiple performance measures. We show that such an index contract may indeed be optimal if performance measures are nonverifiable so that the contracting parties must rely on self-enforcement. Under commonly invoked assumptions (including normally distributed measurements), we show that the weights in the index reflect a tradeoff between distortion and precision for the measures. The efficiency of the contract improves with higher precision of the index measure, because this strengthens incentives, and correlations between measurements may for this reason be beneficial. There is a caveat, however, because the index contract is not necessarily optimal for very precise measurements, although it is shown to be asymptotically optimal. We also consider hybrid measurements, and show that the principal may want to include verifiable performance measures in the relational index contract in order to improve incentives, and that this has noteworthy implications for the formal contract."
The (Un)Controllability Principle: The Benefits of Holding Employees Accountable for Uncontrollable Factors,JACOB ZUREICH,30 November 2022,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12467,"ABSTRACTThe controllability principle suggests that employees should not be held accountable for factors outside their control. This study develops novel theory to challenge that thinking. According to the theory, holding employees accountable for uncontrollable factors like peer performance can lead to improved decision-making by increasing how much employees learn from those uncontrollable factors. I expect this effect to occur because goal-focused employees only consider information that seems goal-relevant, and uncontrollable factors only seem goal relevant when employees are held accountable for them. Results from a decision-making experiment support the theory. In particular, paying participants based on uncontrollable factors improves their decision-making despite providing them with weaker economic incentives. This positive effect is more pronounced when the uncontrollable factors are more informative and when individuals are more goal-focused. These findings reveal a previously unexplored benefit of disregarding the controllability principle that can help explain why broad, uncontrollable metrics are so prevalent and successful in practice."
CECL: Timely Loan Loss Provisioning and Bank Regulation,LUCAS MAHIEUX,05 October 2022,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12463,"ABSTRACTWe investigate how provisioning models interact with bank regulation to affect banks' risk-taking behavior. We study an accuracy versus timeliness trade-off between an incurred loss model (IL) and an expected loss model (EL) such as current expected credit loss model or International Financial Reporting Standards 9. Relative to IL, even though EL improves efficiency by prompting earlier corrective action in bad times, it induces banks to originate either safer or riskier loans. Trading off ex post benefits versus ex ante real effects, we show that more timely information under EL enhances efficiency either when banks are insufficiently capitalized or when regulatory intervention is likely to be effective. Conversely, when banks are moderately capitalized and regulatory intervention is sufficiently costly, switching to EL impairs efficiency. From a policy perspective, our analysis highlights the roles that regulatory capital and the effectiveness of regulatory intervention play in determining the economic consequences of provisioning models. EL spurs credit supply and improves financial stability in economies where intervening in banks' operations is relatively frictionless and/or regulators can tailor regulatory capital to incorporate information about credit losses."
Creativity Contests: An Experimental Investigation of Eliciting Employee Creativity,JASMIJN BOL,01 November 2022,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12466,"ABSTRACTRunning a contest can help managers elicit creative ideas from employees by providing employees with incentives to develop and share ideas that will help the firm. Little is known, however, about how contest design affects the outcomes of subjectively evaluated creativity-based contests. We conduct an experiment to investigate the impact of two contest design choices, the job role of the contest's evaluator, and the number of prizes that participants compete for, on employee participation behavior. We also examine how these contest design choices impact the creativity of the submitted ideas. We find that using a peer of the employees as an evaluator increases the number of ideas shared, but it does not impact the number of unique participants who enter the contest. In addition, we find that using peer evaluators leads to an increase in the creativity of the ideas. We find that awarding more prizes to participants does not increase overall participation, but it does increase the number of ideas shared by employees from underrepresented demographics. Awarding more prizes, however, reduces the creativity of the ideas. Together, these results show that contest design choices have an important impact on employee creative idea-sharing and that managers should carefully consider how to tailor contests to fit their firms' needs."
Boosting Foreign Investment: The Role of Certification of Corporate Governance,PIETRO BONETTI,15 December 2022,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12468,"ABSTRACTThis paper studies the economic consequences of certification of corporate governance practices. For identification, we exploit a recent cross-country initiative by a coalition of key institutions in Southeast Asia; the periodic publication of a “Top List” of companies in the region selected based on an independent assessment of corporate governance practices. Our results suggest that being included in the list induces an increase in foreign investment and changes in corporate governance practices. The announcement of the Top List elicits a positive stock market response among constituents and is followed by higher accounting performance. Overall, the evidence suggests that the certification of governance practices is a meaningful tool to boost foreign investment."
The Complementarity Between Signal Informativeness and Monitoring,PIERRE CHAIGNEAU,26 August 2022,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12459,"ABSTRACTA firm that must decide whether to retain or terminate a manager can rely on several sources of information to assess managerial ability. When it relies on a performance signal and monitoring, we show that a more informative signal can surprisingly increase the value of monitoring. Then, signal precision and monitoring are complements. This happens if a more precise information system makes some signals more negative indicators of managerial ability that still do not trigger termination. When the turnover cost is high enough and the manager is more entrenched after a positive performance, an increase in signal precision increases expected monitoring. In firms with a high turnover cost, a less informative signal is compounded by worse monitoring after a disappointing performance. This “bad corporate governance trap” makes it hard for these firms to eventually improve performance."
Does Sensationalism Affect Executive Compensation? Evidence from Pay Ratio Disclosure Reform,WONJAE CHANG,26 July 2022,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12458,"ABSTRACTBeginning in 2018, U.S. public firms were required to report the ratio of the chief executive officer's (CEO) compensation to their median employee's compensation in the annual proxy statement. Exploiting the staggered reporting of pay ratios, we find little evidence that total CEO compensation changes in response to pay ratio disclosure reform. However, we do find that boards significantly adjust the mix of compensation awarded by reducing the sensitivity of CEO pay to equity price changes, particularly when the CEO is likely to garner media scrutiny, and by reducing reliance on stock-based and other compensation components that are most susceptible to media coverage surrounding the pay ratio disclosure. Firms ultimately disclosing higher pay ratios garner more media coverage around the filing of their proxy statement, and more negative-toned coverage in the subsequent month. Finally, we find evidence that greater pay disparity is associated with greater selling activity by retail investors and more negative say-on-pay votes following pay ratio reform, consistent with a broad set of investors responding to public scrutiny resulting from pay ratio disclosures."
"Anti-Mafia Police Actions, Criminal Firms, and Peer Firm Tax Avoidance",JUSTIN CHIRCOP,12 July 2022,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12455,"ABSTRACTMafia firms introduce distortions in the markets in which they operate, increasing the cost of doing business for peer firms. We investigate whether peers respond by increasing their tax avoidance and thus increasing funds available to compete with the Mafia firms. Using a sample of Italian anti-Mafia police actions that resulted in the removal of Mafia firms and a difference-in-differences approach, we find that peers reduce their tax avoidance following these actions. We further show that, following anti-Mafia police actions, peer firms improve their performance and increase capital investment while enjoying a reduction in the cost of raw materials. Overall, our results highlight the microlevel channels through which Mafia can affect firm outcomes and local economies."
Renewable Governance: Good for the Environment?,ALEXANDER DYCK,29 October 2022,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12462,"ABSTRACTWe conjecture that board renewal mechanisms—those substantive enough to renew the thinking of the board—are required before investors can address the mismatch between their preferences regarding environmental sustainability and what insiders at firms are actually doing. We identify the adoption of majority voting for directors and the introduction of a female director as two corporate governance mechanisms potentially strong enough to renew a board's thinking on sustainability. Using a sample of 3,293 firms from 41 countries, along with quasi-exogenous shocks to board renewal mechanisms in Canada and France, we find that both board renewal mechanisms are associated with significantly higher future environmental performance. Further tests provide suggestive evidence that board renewal is more strongly associated with environmental performance in settings with better institutions and more motivated institutional investors. These results suggest the importance of board renewal for alignment of firm policies with investor preferences around the world."
Relative Valuation with Machine Learning,PAUL GEERTSEMA,06 October 2022,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12464,"ABSTRACTWe use machine learning for relative valuation and peer firm selection. In out-of-sample tests, our machine learning models substantially outperform traditional models in valuation accuracy. This outperformance persists over time and holds across different types of firms. The valuations produced by machine learning models behave like fundamental values. Overvalued stocks decrease in price and undervalued stocks increase in price in the following month. Determinants of valuation multiples identified by machine learning models are consistent with theoretical predictions derived from a discounted cash flow approach. Profitability ratios, growth measures, and efficiency ratios are the most important value drivers throughout our sample period. We derive a novel method to express valuation multiples predicted by our machine learning models as weighted averages of peer firm multiples. These weights are a measure of peer–firm comparability and can be used for selecting peer-groups."
The Value of Mandatory Certification: A Real Effects Perspective,XU JIANG,12 September 2022,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12460,"ABSTRACTWe study the real effects of certification to demonstrate the value of mandatory certification over and above mandatory disclosure in enhancing investment efficiency. In our model, a firm's manager selects a project to maximize the firm's short-term stock price, which is a function of her certification and disclosure decisions about the outcome of the project. Although the manager might be either forthcoming or strategic with regard to the disclosure of her private information, she can strategically choose whether to incur a cost or not to certify her disclosure, unless mandated. The manager always selects the first-best project when both certification and disclosure are mandatory. However, when certification is voluntary, project selection is inefficient. In addition, mandating disclosure without mandating certification can lead to lower investment efficiency than mandating neither. In justifying why mandatory certification is beneficial for public firms, our results offer a note of caution regarding the contemplated regulatory moves for increased disclosures by public firms without corresponding certification requirements, for example, the recent SEC proposal requiring extensive climate-related disclosure."
Does a Government Mandate Crowd Out Voluntary Corporate Social Responsibility? Evidence from India,SHIVARAM RAJGOPAL,16 September 2022,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12461,"ABSTRACTThis study investigates the implementation of a Government of India mandate that requires firms to spend at least 2% of their profits on corporate social responsibility (CSR). The results show that qualifying firms that voluntarily engaged in CSR before the mandate reduce their CSR spending afterward. Despite increasing advertisement expenditure likely to offset the lost signaling value of voluntary CSR, stock prices and operating performance of former voluntary CSR spenders who qualify under the law decline. Our results suggest that regulatory intervention in CSR can both diminish its signaling value and lead to a reduction in voluntary CSR spending."
The Role of Information in Building a More Sustainable Economy: A Supply and Demand Perspective,HENRY L. FRIEDMAN,18 October 2024,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12581,"ABSTRACTInterest in sustainability information, from investors, managers, researchers, and others, has been expanding rapidly. We discuss recent advances and open questions related to sustainability reporting and disclosure through the lens of a supply and demand framework. Our discussion builds on prior research on financial reporting and highlights unique aspects of the provision of sustainability information."
ESG Disclosures in the Private Equity Industry,JEFFERSON ABRAHAM,28 August 2024,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12570,"ABSTRACTThis paper offers the first systematic evidence on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) disclosures provided by a large global sample of private equity (PE) firms. Using historical websites from 2000 to 2022, we develop and validate a novel dictionary-based measure of voluntary PE firm ESG disclosures. Descriptive statistics reveal an increasing time trend in these disclosures, with social topics becoming as important as environmental topics recently. Multivariate analyses show that the demand for ESG information from fund investors is a significant determinant of PE firms’ ESG disclosures. Leveraging data on PE firms’ portfolio companies, we document that more PE firm ESG disclosures are associated with better ESG outcomes at the portfolio company level, suggesting that voluntary ESG disclosures align with real actions for the average PE firm."
Diversity Washing,ANDREW C. BAKER,25 April 2024,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12542,"ABSTRACTWe provide large-sample evidence on whether U.S. publicly traded corporations use voluntary disclosures about their commitments to employee diversity opportunistically. We document significant discrepancies between companies' external stances on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and their hiring practices. Firms that discuss DEI excessively relative to their actual employee gender and racial diversity (“diversity washers”) obtain superior scores from environmental, social, and governance (ESG) rating organizations and attract more investment from institutional investors with an ESG focus. These outcomes occur even though diversity-washing firms are more likely to incur discrimination violations and have negative human-capital-related news events. Our study provides evidence consistent with growing allegations of misleading statements from firms about their DEI initiatives and highlights the potential consequences of selective ESG disclosures."
The Financially Material Effects of Mandatory Nonfinancial Disclosure,BRIAN GIBBONS,18 July 2023,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12499,"ABSTRACTComplaints from institutional investors suggest that principles-based disclosure regimes that rely on financial materiality standards produce inadequate nonfinancial environmental and social (E&S) information. Using the staggered introduction of 40 country-level regulations that mandate disclosure, I document that reporting E&S information relates to increased investment from institutional owners and has material effects on firms’ investment and financing decisions. Firms mandated to disclose E&S information allocate more investment toward long-term, innovative projects and raise more equity capital. Evidence indicates that disclosure attracts long-term–oriented institutional clientele with E&S preferences, which then feeds back on firm decision making. Although the effects of nonfinancial disclosure are similar to those of improved financial disclosure, this clientele mechanism is unique. Taken together, these results suggest that jurisdictions that rely solely on financial materiality disclosure standards create nonfinancial information frictions with material effects on investors and firm decision making."
Comply or Explain: Do Firms Opportunistically Claim Trade Secrets in Mandatory Environmental Disclosure Programs?,YILE (ANSON) JIANG,15 October 2024,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12583,"ABSTRACTThis paper studies whether firms opportunistically make proprietary claims in mandatory environmental disclosure programs with trade secret exemption rules. Examining the mandatory chemical disclosure program in the fracking industry, I find evidence of opportunistic withholding of information among operators that are less likely to have trade secrets. Specifically, I find that these operators claim fewer chemicals as trade secrets when the operating site is in close proximity to water quality monitors. This is only observed among publicly traded operators that face a higher cost of societal backlash when disclosing pollutant information. Further analyses suggest that these operators are concerned about external environmental monitoring, which deters them from opportunistic information withholding. Regarding public and private operators that are more likely to have trade secrets, I do not find strong evidence that their information withholding varies with the monitoring conditions."
The Effects of Mandatory ESG Disclosure Around the World,PHILIPP KRUEGER,04 May 2024,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12548,"ABSTRACTWe compile a novel data set on mandatory environmental, social, and governance (ESG) disclosure around the world to analyze the stock liquidity effects of such disclosure mandates. We document a positive effect of ESG disclosure mandates on firm-level stock liquidity. The effects are strongest if the disclosure requirements are implemented by government institutions, not on a comply-or-explain basis, and coupled with strong enforcement by informal institutions. Firms with weaker information environments benefit more from ESG disclosure mandates. Our results support the view that ESG disclosure regulation improves the information environment and has beneficial capital market effects."
On the EPA's Radar: The Role of Financial Reports in Environmental Regulatory Oversight,BIN LI,03 September 2024,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12572,"ABSTRACTThis paper investigates the role of corporate financial reports in the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) regulatory activities. By tracking the EPA's direct retrieval of SEC filings, we identify three key findings. First, the EPA retrieves a large volume of financial reports, especially from firms in high-pollution industries. Second, the EPA is more likely to access financial reports during enforcement investigations and significant rule proposals, but less so during compliance monitoring, with patterns varying predictably across firms. Third, the EPA's reliance on financial reports is potentially driven by its demand for information on firm liquidity, solvency, and profitability. Overall, our study highlights the usefulness of financial reports for the EPA as an environmental regulator."
Do Commercial Ties Influence ESG Ratings? Evidence from Moody's and S&P,XUANBO LI,06 November 2024,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12582,"ABSTRACTWe provide the first evidence that conflicts of interest arising from commercial ties lead to bias in environmental, social, and governance (ESG) ratings. Using the acquisitions of Vigeo Eiris and RobecoSAM by Moody's and S&P as shocks to the commercial ties between ESG rating agencies and their rated firms, we show that, after their acquisitions by the credit rating agencies (CRAs), ESG rating agencies issue higher ratings to existing paying clients of the CRAs. This effect is greater for firms that have more intensive business relationships with the CRAs, but weaker for firms with more transparent ESG disclosures or higher long-term institutional ownership. The upwardly biased ESG ratings help client firms issue more green bonds and enable the CRAs to maintain credit rating business. Finally, the upwardly biased ESG ratings are less informative of future ESG news. Overall, the business incentives of rating providers appear to engender ESG rating bias."
Global Evolution of Environmental and Social Disclosure in Annual Reports,Yan Lin,12 September 2024,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12575,"ABSTRACTWe study environmental and social (E&S) disclosures in annual reports. Using the word embedding model to examine over 210,000 annual reports from 24,271 public firms in 30 international countries/regions between 2001 and 2020, we create an E&S dictionary that allows us to document trends in annual report E&S disclosure. Specifically, we find: (1) increases in length and boilerplate language and (2) decreases in specificity. Our results also suggest that E&S disclosure quality improves after the adoption of voluntary ESG reporting frameworks but deteriorates after disclosure mandates. Our findings provide systematic evidence on the evolution of E&S disclosure in annual reports over the past two decades and shed light on how voluntary and mandatory standards have shaped global E&S reporting practices."
"Sexism, Culture, and Firm Value: Evidence from the Harvey Weinstein Scandal and the #MeToo Movement",KARL V. LINS,04 September 2024,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12573,"ABSTRACTDuring the revelation of the Harvey Weinstein scandal and the reemergence of the #MeToo movement, firms with a nonsexist corporate culture, proxied by having women among the five highest-paid executives, earn excess returns of 1.3% relative to firms without female top executives. These returns are driven by changes in investor preferences toward firms with a nonsexist culture. Institutional ownership increases in firms with a nonsexist culture after the Weinstein/#MeToo events, particularly for investors with larger holdings and investors with a lower ESG focus ex ante. Firms without female top executives improve gender diversity after these events, particularly in more sexist states and in industries with few women executives. Our evidence attests to the value of having a nonsexist corporate culture and indicates that changes in societal norms toward women are permeating into capital markets and corporations."
News Bias in Financial Journalists’ Social Networks,GUOSONG XU,18 June 2024,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12560,"ABSTRACTConnected financial journalists—those with working relationships, common school ties, or social media connections to company management—introduce a marked media slant into their news coverage. Using a comprehensive set of newspaper articles covering mergers and acquisition (M&A) transactions from 1997 to 2016, I find that connected journalists use significantly fewer negative words in their coverage of connected acquirers. These journalists are also more likely to quote connected executives and include less accurate language in their reporting. Moreover, they tend to portray other firms in the same network in a less negative light. Journalists’ favoritism bias has implications for both capital market outcomes and their careers. I find that acquirers whose M&As are covered by connected journalists receive significantly higher stock returns on the news article publication date. However, these acquirers’ stock prices reverse in the long term, suggesting market overreaction to news covered by connected journalists. Around M&A transactions, connected articles are correlated with increased bid competition and deal premiums. In terms of future career development, connected journalists are more likely to leave journalism and join their associated industries in the long run. Taken together, the evidence suggests that financial journalists’ personal networks promote news bias that potentially hinders the efficient dissemination of information."
Using and Interpreting Fixed Effects Models,MATTHIAS BREUER,13 June 2024,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12559,"ABSTRACTFixed effects (FE) have emerged as a ubiquitous and powerful tool for eliminating unwanted variation in observational accounting studies. Unwanted variation is plentiful in accounting research because we often use rich data to test precise hypotheses derived from abstract theories. By eliminating unwanted variation, FE reduce concerns that omitted variables bias our estimates or weaken test power. FE are not costless, though, so their use should be carefully justified by theoretical and institutional considerations. FE also transform samples and variables in ways that are not immediately apparent, and in doing so affect how we should interpret regression results. This primer explains the mechanics of FE and provides practical guidance for the informed use, transparent reporting, and careful interpretation of FE models."
Equity Incentive Plans and Board of Director Discretion over Equity Grants,BRIAN CADMAN,12 March 2024,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12532,"ABSTRACTEquity compensation is granted out of an equity incentive plan that must be approved by shareholders and cedes discretion over equity grants to boards of directors. We predict and find that equity plan proposals give boards more discretion over grants when the firm faces greater labor market forces and more volatile stock returns. When examining votes, we find that shareholders are less likely to support plans with abnormal discretion. We also find that boards with more discretion grant more equity in response to stock price declines. Lastly, we find that boards request additional shares when their ability to grant equity is more constrained by a smaller pool of available shares, and when they plan to increase equity grants. Overall our findings illuminate how firms balance needs to respond to labor market pressure and volatile operating environments against shareholder governance and oversight of equity compensation."
When Employees Go to Court: Employee Lawsuits and Talent Acquisition in Audit Offices,JADE HUAYU CHEN,24 March 2024,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12534,"ABSTRACTI examine whether employee-initiated lawsuits against an audit office adversely affect its ability to attract high-quality talent and deliver quality audits. I posit that employee lawsuits erode prospective employees’ perceptions of an office, diminishing their willingness to join. Using a comprehensive data set of individual auditor profiles, I find a decline in the quality of newly hired auditors following an employee lawsuit. Cross-sectionally, the adverse effect of employee lawsuits on talent acquisition is more pronounced when an office is undergoing higher growth and when a case receives greater media attention. Conversely, this adverse effect is less pronounced when an audit office is larger or offers more competitive wages within the local area. When an audit office is unable to recruit high-quality talent, its audit quality is likely to suffer. Consistent with this, I find a deterioration in audit quality provided by an office following an employee lawsuit. Overall, this study underscores the importance of human capital management and employer reputation for audit offices that operate in competitive labor markets."
Social Comparison on Multiple Tasks: Sacrificing Overall Performance for Local Excellence?,MAXIMILIAN KOHLER,26 March 2024,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12535,"ABSTRACTThis field experiment investigates how different levels of aggregation in relative performance information (RPI) impact employee performance in environments with multiple tasks. We randomly assign store employees of a retail chain to three groups: RPI on overall performance (control group), RPI on separate tasks, and RPI on both overall performance and separate tasks. We do not find evidence that providing separate task RPI instead of overall RPI affects performance or effort allocation. However, providing RPI on both overall performance and separate tasks seems to reduce performance, especially in the low-return task. This suggests that detailed RPI directs employees’ attention to the smaller benefits of low-return tasks. We further find that only 30.5% of the employees accessed their performance reports, highlighting a distinction between providing RPI in the field and the laboratory. This study is based on a registered report accepted by theJournal of Accounting Research."
Home Sweet Home: CEOs Acquiring Firms in Their Birth Countries,ANTONIO MARRA,19 March 2024,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12533,"ABSTRACTWe find that foreign-born CEOs are more inclined than domestic-born ones to acquire across borders, and that this inclination is explained by their preference for targets in their birth country. This preference is motivated by foreign-born CEOs’ information advantage in their birth country and by these CEOs’ desire to give back to the birth country. CEOs’ desire to help their birth country also influences target location, increasing the likelihood of a target in countries that colonized the CEO birth country. The motives that drive acquisitions in acquirer CEOs’ birth countries measurably affect the returns of acquirers’ shareholders, target premium, and acquisition synergy. Both acquirers’ returns and synergy but not target premium are abnormally positive when the motive for an acquisition is a CEO's information advantage in the birth country. Targets premiums but not acquirers’ returns and synergy are abnormally positive when the motive for an acquisition is the desire to give back to the CEO's birth country."
Show Your Hand: The Impacts of Fair Pricing Requirements in Procurement Contracting,BRAD NATHAN,03 July 2024,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12561,"ABSTRACTThis paper studies how a federal procurement regulation, known as the Truth in Negotiations Act (TINA), affects the competitiveness and execution of government contracts. TINA stipulates how contracting officials (COs) can ensure reasonable prices. Following TINA, for contracts above a certain size threshold, COs can no longer rely solely on their own judgment that a price is reasonable. Instead, they must either require suppliers to provide accounting data supporting their proposed prices or expect multiple bids. Using a regression discontinuity design, I find that above-threshold contracts experience greater competition (i.e., more bids), improved performance (i.e., less frequent renegotiations and cost overruns), and reduced use of the harder-to-monitor cost-plus pricing, compared to below-threshold contracts. These findings suggest that TINA's requirements enhance competition and oversight for above-threshold contracts."
Government Subsidies and Corporate Misconduct,ANEESH RAGHUNANDAN,18 May 2024,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12553,"ABSTRACTI study whether firms that receive targeted U.S. state-level subsidies are more likely to subsequently engage in corporate misconduct. I find that firms are more likely to engage in misconduct in subsidizing states, but not in other states that they operate in, after receiving state subsidies. Using data on both federal and state enforcement actions, and exploiting the legal principle of dual sovereignty for identification, I show that this finding reflects an increase in the underlying rate of misconduct and that this increase is attributable to lenient state-level misconduct enforcement. Collectively, my findings present evidence of an important consequence of targeted firm-specific subsidies: nonfinancial misconduct that potentially could impact the very stakeholders subsidies are ostensibly intended to benefit."
The Capital Market Effects of Centralizing Regulated Financial Information,GURPAL SRAN,29 April 2024,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12544,"ABSTRACTWe study the capital market effects of information centralization by exploiting the staggered implementation of digital storage and access platforms for regulated financial information (Officially Appointed Mechanisms, or OAMs) in the European Union. We find that the implementation of OAMs results in significant improvements in capital market liquidity, consistent with the notion that OAMs lower investors' processing costs. The findings are more pronounced when processing costs are high to begin with, that is, when firms (1) are small and receive low business press coverage and (2) have high levels of retail ownership. We then identify a mechanism through which centralization facilitates capital market effects: information spillovers. First, we find that liquidity improvements are larger when OAMs have features that easily allow investors to search for peer firm information. Second, liquidity improvements are larger for firms with a high share of industry peers operating on the same OAM and for firms with a high share of small, low-coverage peers on that OAM. Third, around the annual report release dates of peer firms, focal-firm liquidity improves and focal-peer stock return synchronicity increases. Overall, our evidence suggests that, even in a modern information age, information centralization improves capital market liquidity and facilitates the acquisition and use of peer firm information."
Algorithmic Trading and Forward-Looking MD&A Disclosures,WAYNE B. THOMAS,01 April 2024,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12540,"ABSTRACTThis study examines how algorithmic trading (AT) affects forward-looking disclosures in Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) of annual reports. We predict and find evidence that AT relates negatively to modifications in year-over-year forward-looking MD&A disclosures. This evidence is consistent with AT reducing investors’ demand for fundamental information, which reduces managers’ incentives to supply costly forward-looking disclosures. Cross-sectional tests provide additional evidence that this negative relation is more pronounced for firms with larger earnings surprises and those with losses. We further validate our conclusion by demonstrating that investors’ fundamental information searches are a channel through which AT affects forward-looking disclosures. The conclusion is robust to using the SEC's Tick Size Pilot Program as an exogenous shock to AT and to using alternative disclosure measures (e.g., tone revisions and number of sentences in forward-looking MD&A disclosures). Overall, our study demonstrates that AT is a contributing factor to regulators’ concerns over the diminishing usefulness of forward-looking information in MD&A disclosures."
Fraud Power Laws,EDWIGE CHEYNEL,30 December 2023,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12520,"ABSTRACTUsing misstatement data, we find that the distribution of detected fraud features a heavy tail. We propose a theoretical mechanism that explains such a relatively high frequency of extreme frauds. In our dynamic model, a manager manipulates earnings for personal gain. A monitor of uncertain quality can detect fraud and punish the manager. As the monitor fails to detect fraud, the manager's posterior belief about the monitor's effectiveness decreases. Over time, the manager's learning leads to a slippery slope, in which the size of frauds grows steeply, and to a power law for detected fraud. Empirical analyses corroborate the slippery slope and the learning channel. As a policy implication, we establish that a higher detection intensity can increase fraud by enabling the manager to identify an ineffective monitor more quickly. Further, nondetection of frauds below a materiality threshold, paired with a sufficiently steep punishment scheme, can prevent large frauds."
Relative Performance Evaluation and Strategic Peer-Harming Disclosures,MATTHEW J. BLOOMFIELD,02 May 2024,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12543,"ABSTRACTMany firms use relative stock performance to evaluate and incentivize their CEOs. We document that such firms routinely disclose information that harms their peers' stock prices, and sometimes explicitly mention the harmed peers, by name, in these disclosures. Consistent with deliberate sabotage, peer-harming disclosures appear to be aimed at peers whose stock price depressions are most likely to benefit the disclosing firms' CEOs. The pricing effect of these disclosures does not reverse, suggesting that the disclosures contain legitimate information regarding peers' prospects. In sum, our results suggest that relative performance evaluation in CEO pay motivates CEOs to internalize the externalities of their disclosures, and strategically disclose information that harms peers' stock prices, in order to improve their firms' relative standing within their peer group."
Innovation and Financial Disclosure,HUI CHEN,25 April 2024,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12546,"ABSTRACTWe examine how financial disclosure policy affects a firm manager's strategy to innovate within a two-period bandit problem featuring two production methods: an old method with a known probability of success, and a new method with an unknown probability. Exploring the new method in the first period provides the manager with decision-useful information for the second period, thus creating a real option that is unavailable under exploiting the old known production method. Voluntary disclosure of the firm's financial performance provides the manager with another option to potentially conceal initial failure from the market. The interaction of these two options determines the manager's incentive to explore. In equilibrium, a myopic manager who cares about the interim market price may over- or under-explore compared to the optimal exploration strategy that maximizes firm value. Our analysis shows that firms operating in an environment with voluntary disclosure early in the trial stage and mandated requirement later are most motivated to explore, while firms subject to early mandated disclosure and late voluntary disclosure are least likely to do so. We also provide empirical predictions about the link between the disclosure environment and the intensity and efficiency of corporate innovation."
What Role Do Boards Play in Companies with Visionary CEOs?,XU JIANG,16 October 2023,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12514,"ABSTRACTVisionary CEOs have strong beliefs about the right course of action for their firms. How should a board of directors that does not necessarily share the visionary CEO's confidence advise and monitor the CEO? We consider a model in which the board can acquire costly information about the firm's optimal strategic direction. The board not only advises the CEO on strategy, but also must approve it, and the CEO exerts effort to implement the strategy. We find that the board gathers less information when the CEO believes more strongly in his vision. Further, depending on the strength of the CEO's belief bias, the board either plays an advisory role, a monitoring role, or a rubberstamping role. The model predicts that in firms that are led by highly visionary CEOs, boards are passive in that they acquire little information and rubberstamp the visionary's proposal. Nevertheless, shareholders prefer the visionary over an unbiased manager in industries in which obtaining information about the correct course of action is difficult and costly."
Economics of Information Search and Financial Misreporting,JUNG MIN KIM,14 February 2024,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12528,"ABSTRACTI examine how investors’ search for different types of information affects managers’ reporting decisions. I distinguish investors’ search for information about firm fundamentals (“fundamental search”) from their search for information about managers’ incentives (“incentive search”). Based on a parsimonious model of misreporting, I predict that fundamental search reduces the earnings response coefficient, which reduces managers’ benefits from misreporting, resulting in less misreporting. In contrast, incentive search increases the earnings response coefficient, which increases the benefits from misreporting, resulting in more misreporting. I test these predictions using an empirical technique that classifies EDGAR downloads as fundamental search or incentive search. Consistent with my theoretical predictions, I find that fundamental (incentive) search is negatively (positively) related to the earnings response coefficients and intentional restatements. I confirm my findings in two distinct empirical settings where the costs of information search exogenously changed: the adoption of XBRL and the electronic filing mandate of Form 4s. Collectively, the results show that investors’ information demand can shape managers’ reporting decisions, and its effects can vary depending on the type of information investors search for."
The Impact of Information Frictions Within Regulators: Evidence from Workplace Safety Violations,ANEESH RAGHUNANDAN,01 April 2024,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12541,"ABSTRACTThe Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is decentralized, wherein field offices coordinated at the state level undertake inspections. We study whether this structure can lead to interstate frictions in sharing information and how this impacts firms’ compliance with workplace safety laws. We find that firms caught violating in one state subsequently violate less in that state but violate more in other states. Despite this pattern, and in keeping with information frictions, violations in one state do not trigger proactive OSHA inspections in other states. Moreover, firms face lower monetary penalties when subsequent violations occur across state lines, likely due to the lack of documentation necessary to assess severe penalties. Finally, firms are more likely to shift violating behavior into states with greater information frictions. Our findings suggest that internal information within regulators impacts the likelihood and location of corporate misconduct."
Bridging Theory and Empirical Research in Accounting,MATTHIAS BREUER,26 April 2024,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12545,"ABSTRACTFormal theory and empirical research are complementary in building and advancing the body of knowledge in accounting in order to understand real-world phenomena. We offer thoughts on opportunities for empiricists and theorists to collaborate, build on each other's work, and iterate over models and data to make progress. For empiricists, we see room for more descriptive work, more experimental work on testing formal theories, and more work on quantifying theoretical parameters. For theorists, we see room for theories explicitly tied to descriptive evidence, new theories on individuals' decision making in a data-rich world, theories focused on accounting institutions and measurement issues, and richer theories for guiding empirical work and providing practical insights. We also encourage explicitly combining formal theory and empirical models by having both in one paper and by structural estimation."
Occupational Licensing and Minority Participation in Professional Labor Markets,ANDREW G. SUTHERLAND,12 December 2023,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12518,"ABSTRACTWe examine the staggered adoption of additional educational requirements (“150-hour rule”) for Certified Public Accountants (“CPAs”) to understand the effects of occupational licensing on minority participation in professional labor markets. The 150-hour rule increased the educational requirement for CPAs from 120 to 150 credit hours, effectively adding a fifth year of study. We find a 13% greater entry decline following the requirement's enactment for minority than nonminority CPA candidates. Our analyses of parental income and financial aid availability point to a socioeconomic status channel explaining the differential entry declines. Studying exam passing patterns, professional misconduct, and job postings we find a deterioration, or at best, no change in CPA quality following enactment."
Bank Supervision and Organizational Capital: The Case of Minority Lending,BYEONGCHAN AN,05 March 2024,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12529,"ABSTRACTWe investigate whether improvements in banks' organizational capital and control systems facilitate increased loan origination to minority borrowers. We focus on bank supervisors' enforcement decisions and orders (EDOs) against banks and hypothesize that EDO-imposed improvements in loan policies, internal governance, and employee training mitigate deficiencies in credit assessments and lending decisions that previously disadvantaged minority borrowers. We find that mortgage origination to minority borrowers increases following the resolution of EDOs, and more so for banks with stricter supervisors or more severe EDOs. Using a semisupervised machine learning method to analyze the text of EDOs, we find that such increases are higher for EDOs specifying revisions of loan policies, implementation of formal internal governance procedures, or more employee training. Overall, we find that EDO-driven improvements in organizational capital generate unintended, positive social externalities that enhance access to credit for minority borrowers."
The Real Effects of Supply Chain Transparency Regulation: Evidence from Section 1502 of the Dodd–Frank Act,BOK BAIK,29 February 2024,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12530,"ABSTRACTSection 1502 of the Dodd–Frank Act requires SEC-registered issuers to conduct supply chain due diligence and submit conflict minerals disclosures (CMDs) that indicate whether their products contain tantalum, tin, tungsten, or gold (3TG) sourced from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) or its neighboring countries (“covered countries”). Consistent with the reputational cost hypothesis, we find that heightened public attention to CMDs increases responsible sourcing. After Section 1502 takes effect, we find higher demand for 3TG products processed in certified smelters, decreased conflicts in covered countries’ mining regions relative to other regions, and reduced sensitivity of conflict risk to conflict minerals’ price spikes. Finally, we find that conflicts decrease in Eastern DRC territories with prevalent 3T (tantalum, tin, and tungsten) mines but increase in territories with prevalent gold mines. Overall, our findings highlight the real effects of enhanced supply chain transparency regulation."
The Impact of Credit Market Development on Auditor Choice: Evidence from Banking Deregulation,GUS DE FRANCO,06 December 2023,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12519,"ABSTRACTWe exploit the staggered state-level adoption of the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act (IBBEA) to examine how banking deregulation and the resulting increase in bank competition affect firms’ auditor choices. We find that an exogenous increase in the degree of interstate branch banking deregulation leads to a reduction in firms’ propensity to engage a Big N or industry expert auditor. This main result, when combined with our cross-sectional analyses, offers evidence suggesting that deregulation leads to less demand for higher quality auditors because (1) firms have increased access to credit, which reduces the benefits of higher audit quality; (2) entering banks’ lending expertise substitutes for higher quality financial statements; (3) incumbent banks with less lending expertise seek to protect their rents by preferring that borrowers provide lower quality financial statement information; and (4) external stakeholders delegate their monitoring to banks to a greater degree, resulting in less demand for higher quality financial statements. As such, our study sheds light on how the U.S. credit market's infrastructure shapes firms’ auditor choice decisions."
Payment Practices Transparency and Customer-Supplier Dynamics,JODY GREWAL,07 February 2024,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12521,"ABSTRACTWe exploit
the introduction of the Payment Practices Disclosure Regulation in the United Kingdom (UK) to examine the effects of mandating disclosure of customer-supplier payment practices. We find that nondisclosing small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) experience a reduction in their accounts receivable by 8.3%, consistent with an acceleration of their trade credit collections. Further, SMEs exhibit fewer financial constraints after the regulation. We survey managers from large firms and SMEs to understand the underlying mechanisms. The required disclosures raise large firms’ reputational concerns and shift the bargaining power between large firms and SMEs. Additionally, the new disclosures compel executives at large firms to scrutinize their own firms’ payment practices, leading to increased accountability and a stronger focus on timely payment among senior managers."
How Does Management Voluntary Disclosure Behavior Influence Auditors’ Judgments?,SEAN M. HILLISON,05 March 2024,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12531,"ABSTRACTForward-looking information, often used by auditors to evaluate complex estimates and form conclusions about going-concern audit report modifications, is commonly disclosed voluntarily by U.S. public companies. We experimentally examine how this disclosure behavior affects auditors’ skepticism toward such information. Prior research has shown that investors and analysts frequently interpret voluntarily disclosed forward-looking information as credible. We demonstrate that auditors, in contrast, exhibit greater skepticism toward forecasted information that has been voluntarily disclosed (vs. mandatorily disclosed or held privately) because of their reduced trust in management, even when the forecasts align with prior year trends (vs. being more optimistic). Our results suggest that a manager's decision to disclose, rather than the disclosure content itself, leads to increased auditor skepticism. Our findings have implications not only for audit outcomes, but also for manager disclosure behavior, as increased auditor scrutiny could discourage future voluntary disclosure."
Earnings News and Over-the-Counter Markets,STEFAN J. HUBER,07 February 2024,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12522,"ABSTRACTWe document significant increases in bond market liquidity around earnings announcements. These increases are attributed to decreased search and bargaining costs, which arise from the over-the-counter (OTC) nature of bond markets and outweigh increases in information asymmetry during these periods. Our evidence traces reductions in search and bargaining costs to two sources around earnings announcements: (1) improved access to dealers and (2) increased participation from institutional investors, who can more easily transact with multiple dealers. Overall, our findings highlight a novel channel through which firm-specific information affects asset prices."
"Wrong Kind of Transparency? Mutual Funds’ Higher Reporting Frequency, Window Dressing, and Performance",XIANGANG XIN,20 February 2024,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12527,"ABSTRACTThis study examines whether mandatory increase in reporting frequency exacerbates agency problems. Utilizing the setting of the 2004 SEC mandate on increased reporting frequency of mutual fund holdings, we show that increased reporting frequency elevates window dressing (buying winners or selling losers shortly before the end of the reporting period). This effect is driven by low-skill fund managers’ incentives to generate mixed signals. Funds managed by low-skill managers experience lower returns, more outflows, and a higher collapse rate when their window dressing is elevated after the 2004 rule change. These results suggest that, although higher reporting frequency on agents’ actions can exacerbate signal manipulations, the related manipulation costs improve sorting among agents in the longer term."
Treatment of Accounting Changes and Covenant Violation Errors,CHUNMEI ZHU,19 October 2023,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12515,"ABSTRACTGAAP provisions in loan contracts specify how to address the effect of accounting changes on financial covenants. I document a pronounced upward trend in and the dominance of frozen-on-request (FOR) GAAP provisions, which incorporate accounting changes unless either the borrower or the lender requests a freeze. FOR GAAP streamlines the process of incorporating accounting changes into covenant calculations by obviating the need for renegotiations and prevents opportunistic GAAP freezes by requiring good faith renegotiations. Therefore, FOR GAAP is more likely to incorporate accounting changes beneficial to covenant informativeness, leading to lower false positives (i.e., Type I errors of financial covenant violations) and false negatives (i.e., Type II errors of financial covenant violations). Based on a large sample of loan contracts, I find that FOR GAAP decreases false positives and false negatives after controlling for self-selection bias and that the decrease is more pronounced when accounting changes relevant to financial covenants are more significant. My study provides new evidence of the role accounting standards and GAAP provisions play in debt contracting efficiency."
By What Criteria Do We Evaluate Accounting? Some Thoughts on Economic Welfare and the Archival Literature,RAY BALL,15 September 2023,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12507,"ABSTRACTThe economic role of an accounting regime is to increase welfare through its effects—in conjunction with complementary institutions—on firm and household behavior. I review three major streams of the archival literature (real effects; price effects, including value relevance; and costly contracting), in terms of what they can and cannot reveal as proxies for welfare effects. One conclusion is that the partial correlations and average effects that predominate in this literature have provided valuable insights into the role of accounting in the economy, but provide limited and misleading proxies for welfare effects. A major concern is that teachers, students, and researchers—indeed, regulators and standard setters—raised on this literature could lose sight of, and underestimate, the fundamental contribution of accounting to aggregate welfare."
Information Complementarities and the Dynamics of Transparency Shock Spillovers,SHANTANU BANERJEE,03 October 2023,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12510,"ABSTRACTWe show that information complementarities play an important role in the spillover of transparency shocks. We exploit the revelation of financial misconduct by S&P 500 firms, and in a “Stacked Difference-in-Differences” design, find that the implied cost of capital increases for “close” industry peers of the fraudulent firms relative to “distant” industry peers. The spillover effect is particularly strong when the close peers and the fraudulent firm share common analyst coverage and common institutional ownership, which have been shown to be powerful proxies for fundamental linkages and information complementarities. We provide evidence that increase in the cost of capital of peer firms is due, at least in part, to “beta shocks.” Disclosure by close peers—especially those with co-coverage and co-ownership links—also increases following fraud revelation. Although disclosure remains high in the following years, the cost of equity starts to decrease."
How Does Carbon Footprint Information Affect Consumer Choice? A Field Experiment,BIANCA BEYER,14 August 2023,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12505,"ABSTRACTThis paper reports the results of a field experiment investigating how attributes of carbon footprint information affect consumer choice in a large dining facility. Our hypotheses and research methods were preregistered via theJournal of Accounting Research’s registration-based editorial process. Manipulating the measurement units and visualizations of carbon footprint information on food labels, we quantify effects on consumers’ food choices. Treated consumers choose less carbon-intensive dishes, reducing their food-related carbon footprint by up to 9.2%, depending on the treatment. Effects are strongest for carbon footprint information expressed in monetary units (“environmental costs”) and color-coded in the familiar traffic-light scheme. A postexperimental survey shows that these effects obtain although few respondents self-report concern for the environmental footprint of their meal choices. Our study contributes to the accounting literature by using an information-processing framework to shed light on the information usage and decision-making processes of an increasingly important user group of accounting information: consumers."
Price Rigidities and the Value of Public Information,LIFENG GU,08 June 2023,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12495,"ABSTRACTFirms' inflexibility in adjusting output prices to economic shocks exacerbates information asymmetry with respect to firms' profits, but public information on firms' cost structure mitigates this problem. We construct a novel form of public information from economic statistics disclosed by the government and find that such public information significantly reduces inflexible-price firms' bid–ask spreads, the probability of informed trading, and analyst forecast dispersions, but these results do not hold for flexible-price firms. Security analysts seek more cost-related information during conference calls about inflexible-price firms, but such a phenomenon is observed less frequently if a firm's input cost is more publicly observable. In addition, stock markets react more strongly to earning news announced by inflexible-price firms, consistent with our intuition."
Cultural Origin and Minority Shareholder Expropriation: Historical Evidence,ZHIHUI GU,25 October 2023,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12517,"ABSTRACTCan culture explain regional differences in minority shareholder expropriation? Examining regional variation in China, we document that the influence of historical Confucian values persists, despite decades of political movements clamping down on these values, and that these values reduce minority shareholder expropriation in local public firms. The effect on minority shareholder expropriation, in part, operates through the establishment of oversight mechanisms (i.e., greater financial reporting quality and dividend payouts) that constrain expropriation. The findings have important implications for understanding the origins of enduring regional differences in minority shareholder expropriation and capital market development."
Regulatory Transparency and Regulators’ Effort: Evidence from Public Release of the SEC's Review Work,RUI GUO,12 October 2023,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12513,"ABSTRACTUsing the public release of comment letters on EDGAR to capture a regime shift toward regulatory transparency, we examine whether an increase in transparency affects regulators’ effort and work performance. We find that the SEC staff reviews more filings and more documents per filing following the disclosure regime shift. These effects are incrementally stronger for firms with comment letters that are expected to attract greater investor or public monitoring. Furthermore, under the new regime, reviews are more timely. Upon the regime switch, the likelihood of a restatement (receiving a comment letter) decreases (increases) for filings that are reviewed. After receiving a comment letter, a firm with signs of potential fraud is more likely to be investigated, and this effect becomes more pronounced under the new regime. Altogether, our findings suggest that publicly disclosing regulators’ work output can mitigate moral hazard (i.e., increase regulators’ work input), improving their work performance."
Audit Partners’ Role in Material Misstatement Resolution: Survey and Interview Evidence,ELDAR MAKSYMOV,18 August 2023,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12506,"ABSTRACTAuditors are expected to identify and resolve material misstatements (MMs) in management's financial statements. However, beyond the audit opinion, the audit process is opaque. To address this, we independently survey 462 audit partners and interview 24 audit partners, CFOs, and audit committee members on how partners assess and address MM risk, resolve MMs, and the consequences of MMs. Partners identify MMs in approximately 9% (15%) of public (private) engagements and use qualitative factors to waive apparent MMs. Loan covenant and going-concern issues increase MM risk more than earnings benchmark issues. Partners point to a variety of both auditor and client factors as threats to audit effectiveness. Partners often rely on rapport with management and involve the national office and audit committee in resolving MMs. Partner incentives around restatements are context specific. Our results provide new insights into the auditor's role in financial reporting that are relevant to academics, practitioners, and regulators."
Corporate R&D Investments Following Competitors’ Voluntary Disclosures: Evidence from the Drug Development Process,YUE ZHANG,25 September 2023,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12509,"ABSTRACTThis paper examines the role of peer firm disclosures in shaping corporate research and development (R&D) investments. Drawing on models of two-stage R&D races, I hypothesize that a firm could be either deterred or encouraged by peer disclosure of interim R&D success, depending on peer firms’ R&D strength in the race. Using granular, project-level data on clinical trials in the drug development process, I find that a firm's R&D investments in a specific therapeutic area are deterred by disclosures of early-phase trial initiation from strong rivals in the same area but encouraged by disclosures from weak rivals. Cross-sectional analyses show that focal firm strength and disclosure relevance moderate the effects of peer firm disclosure. Overall, my evidence suggests that peer firms’ R&D disclosures can have both proprietary costs and deterrence benefits."
Target Setting in Hierarchies: The Role of Middle Managers,JAN BOUWENS,15 September 2023,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12508,"ABSTRACTWe explore how a supervisor's hierarchical rank affects the extent to which employees’ targets reflect their past performance. Literature documents that supervisors do not fully ratchet targets for past performance, arguably because the commitment not to penalize successful employees with more difficult targets alleviates the severity of the ratchet effect. We argue that commitment is less credible in organizational hierarchies where a middle manager sets employees’ targets. Using data from an organization comprised of three hierarchical layers, we consistently find that a middle manager's exposure to performance pressure is positively associated with the ratcheting of the employees’ targets. Moreover, we show that management at headquarters reduces a middle manager's performance pressure when most of her employees missed their targets in the previous period. Overall, the results imply that the hierarchical rank is an important determinant of the credibility of a supervisor's commitment to deemphasize past performance in target setting."
Transparency in Hierarchies,CHRISTIAN HOFMANN,20 October 2023,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12516,"ABSTRACTWe use an agency model to address the benefits and costs of transparency in a hierarchical organization in which the principal employs a manager entrusted with contracting authority and several workers, all under conditions of moral hazard. We define the principal's transparency choices as a decision to allow workers to observe their coworkers’ performances (observability) and as an investment in monitoring worker performance (precision). We find that whereas precision alleviates agency conflicts as expected, observability can exacerbate agency conflicts, especially if the manager's interests are misaligned sufficiently with those of the principal. Our results suggest several testable hypotheses including predictions that opaque performance measurement practices are well suited for small organizational units at lower hierarchical ranks, and in settings where the sensitivity-precision of the available measures is low, workers’ performances are correlated positively, and managerial productivity is modest."
"Syndicated Lending Relationships, Information Asymmetry, and Market Making in the Secondary Loan Market",MATTHEW A. PHILLIPS,16 July 2025,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.70000,"ABSTRACTThis paper investigates why commercial lenders make markets for the loans that they sell on the secondary market. Using loan-level data, I find that origination lenders with extensive borrower relationships and more reputational capital at stake are more likely to serve as market makers. Greater participation of origination lenders as market makers is associated with lower trading costs for their borrowers' loans. This association remains even in conditions where origination lenders could exploit their information advantage for market making profits. Lenders benefit from being market makers by maintaining strong subsequent lending relationships with their borrowers. Collectively, this evidence is consistent with origination lenders' participation in the secondary market being motivated by reducing trading frictions rather than market making profits."
Real Effects of Hedge Accounting Standards: Evidence from ASU 2017-12,WAQAR ALI,08 April 2025,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12614,"ABSTRACTComplexity in applying financial accounting standards can have real operational effects if firms alter their actions in response to increased reporting costs. We examine whether the introduction of ASU 2017-12, designed to reduce compliance burden and better align hedge accounting rules with risk management practices, led to more effective hedging. Using detailed hedging disclosures, we show that firms that adopt the ASU expand the use of hedge-accounted derivatives and reduce exposures to interest rate and foreign currency risks. ASU-adopting firms also reduce cash flow volatility, increase their use of debt, invest more, and reduce information asymmetry in the equity market. Our analyses reveal that easing hedge effectiveness tests and reliefs targeting “cash flow hedges” and “net investment hedges of foreign operations” were the most influential of the ASU's reforms. Our study is the first to integrate the effects of hedge accounting frictions on firms’ risk management activities and resulting spillovers to debt financing and investments."
Tax Strategy Disclosure: A Greenwashing Mandate?,KATARZYNA BILICKA,11 April 2025,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12617,"ABSTRACTWe investigate the effects of aqualitativetax disclosure mandate aimed at improving tax transparency and compliance by imposing reputational costs for firms. We use, as an exogenous shock, the 2016 UK reform that required large businesses to disclose their tax strategy. We find that treated firms—those that must publish a tax strategy report—also significantly increase the volume of tax strategy disclosure in their annual reports, but this disclosure contains more boilerplate. The standalone tax strategy reports contain narratives similar to those in the annual reports, are sticky, and their quality is correlated with those of disclosures on gender and human rights. Turning to real behavioral changes, we document no significant effect on tax planning across several proxies and firm characteristics. While we find that the mandate increased media attention on treated firms, our results suggest that this enforcement channel might not work in the context of qualitative disclosure, which may be hard to verify for outside stakeholders. Even in subsamples of firms for which we would expect higher reputational costs, we document similar responses. Taken together, our findings indicate that mandating qualitative tax disclosure has incentivized firms to portray themselves as good tax citizens without changing their practices."
Real Effects of Non-Streamlined Sales Tax Administration: Evidence from the Florida Hotel Industry,JENNIFER L. BROWN,10 July 2025,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.70001,"ABSTRACTWe examine whether the local administration of sales taxes (as opposed to a more streamlined state administration) affects the real economy for businesses complying with the tax. We study this question in the Florida hotel industry, as counties in Florida can choose to locally administer the county-level tourist tax or have the state administer the county-level tax along with the state-level tourist tax. Local administration is popular because it supports local employment (of tax administrators) and provides more stringent enforcement on non-commercial operators (e.g., private rentals). State administration, however, has fewer compliance costs for hotels (e.g., reduced filings and fewer audits). Commentary from the profession suggests the incremental compliance costs of local administration can be considerable. We find that counties switching from state to local administration of tourist taxes is associated with slower growth in aggregate hotel payroll and employment, consistent with local tax administration increasing compliance costs to the point that affected businesses cut other services."
The Signaling Value of Internal Employee Coordination,WEI CAI,27 May 2025,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12623,"ABSTRACTWe examine the effect of internal employee coordination on customer trust, focusing specifically on employees’ responsiveness to each other as an important, quantifiable, and objective aspect of internal coordination. Using proprietary data from a company with exogenous assignment of employees to teams that serve individual customers, we study how inter-employee responsiveness influences customer trust. Each customer is served via an app-based group chat by a randomly assigned team of employees. Our data include more than 2 million group chat messages with over 16 thousand customers. We find that inter-employee responsiveness serves as a credible signal that helps build customer trust, as evidenced by their subsequent contracting choices. The effect is more pronounced when the signal is (1) more frequent and (2) more intense. Our findings highlight the novel value of internal employee responsiveness as a credible signal that helps build trust with external stakeholders."
ESG Rating Competition and Rating Quality,CAI CHEN,23 June 2025,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12624,"ABSTRACTThis paper examines how increased competition among environmental, social, and governance (ESG) rating agencies relates to ESG rating quality. We exploit the entry of Sustainalytics as a new ESG rating agency in 2010. We conduct a difference-in-differences analysis and provide three main findings. First, we find that higher competition decreases incumbents' ESG rating disagreements of the same scope. The negative relation between competition and ESG rating disagreement persists for same-scope rating metrics not covered by Sustainalytics, suggesting that neither learning nor herding drive the results. The relationship between competition and rating disagreement strengthens for firms with more ESG disclosures, which generally require more effort to analyze. Second, we find that incumbents' ratings of ESG concerns are more strongly associated with future negative ESG news for firms additionally covered by Sustainalytics. This finding is consistent with competition improving ratings' ability to predict future negative ESG incidents. Third, we find that incumbents evaluate more difficult-to-measure outcome metrics for firms covered by Sustainalytics, consistent with competition inducing more effort. Overall, our findings suggest that competition serves as an implicit disciplining mechanism of ESG rating agencies' quality."
Does U.S. Immigration Policy Facilitate Financial Misconduct?,Ruiting Dai,29 June 2025,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12627,"ABSTRACTWe examine whether U.S. immigration policy, specifically the H-1B visa program, affects the likelihood of financial misconduct. We argue that employers have leverage over employees on H-1B visas because such employees must maintain H-1B–eligible employment to legally reside in the United States. We posit that companies relying on H-1B visas to hire workers in accounting roles have an increased ability to misreport their financial statements due to the greater costs H-1B employees face if they are unexpectedly fired for not following the demands of their bosses or for blowing the whistle on misconduct. Using the sharp reduction in the H-1B visa cap in 2004 as a shock to such employment, we find that companies that relied on this visa program for accounting roles pre-shock experience a 2.3 percentage point decline in accounting irregularities post-shock. Cross-sectional tests show that the reduction in irregularities is greater in companies where H-1B employees have (1) a greater influence on financial reporting or (2) fewer job opportunities. In addition, the relation between H-1B visa use and irregularities is stronger in companies whose investors are more focused on near-term earnings targets. We corroborate our findings using the outcome of H-1B visa lotteries as shocks to such employment."
To Interact or Not? On the Benefits of Interacting with Unfavorable Analysts During Earnings Calls,JARED FLAKE,18 June 2025,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12629,"ABSTRACTManagers prioritize favorable analysts during earnings calls, reinforcing analysts’ incentives for optimism. However, managers also frequently interact with unfavorable analysts, and this study examines the determinants and benefits of these interactions. I find that managers interact more with unfavorable analysts when compelled to do so. I then examine two likely benefits of these interactions. First, unfavorable analysts attenuate their negative views after interacting with managers. Second, price reactions to management forecasts are stronger for managers who regularly interact with unfavorable analysts, consistent with enhanced reporting credibility. Finally, using peer firm restatements as exogenous shocks to investors’ perceptions of accounting quality, I find that nonrestating firms with managers who regularly interact with unfavorable analysts experience attenuated negative returns relative to other nonrestating peers. Overall, the empirical evidence indicates firms experience significant benefits when managers interact with unfavorable analysts and these benefits persist amongst compelled and voluntary interactions."
Responding to Climate Change Crises: Firms' Trade-Offs,FELIX FRITSCH,25 June 2025,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12625,"ABSTRACTWe examine firms' trade-offs in their voluntary disclosure decisions following negative media coverage of climate change incidents. By combining a keyword discovery algorithm and a fine-tuned BERT model, we identify “hard” and “soft” climate disclosures on Twitter. Our findings indicate that firms tend to issue climate tweets as a rapid response to negative climate incidents. Additionally, firms with a history of hard climate change disclosure, as measured by ESG reports, are more likely to issue climate-related responses than firms without such a history. Furthermore, we show that prior hard disclosure is associated with hard responses when the incident receives moderate media attention, but with soft responses when the incident receives low media attention. Our findings provide empirical insights for dynamic disclosure theory by illustrating how prior disclosure shapes firms' response strategies to negative media coverage."
"Index Creation, Information Changes, and Financing*",VIDHAN K. GOYAL,18 June 2025,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12626,"ABSTRACTWe study how stock index inclusion affects corporate financing using a global sample of 198 index events—primarily new index launches—across 21 markets. Firms added to indexes issue more public debt but not equity, leading to a sustained increase in leverage. Inclusion draws greater attention from analysts and the media and increases the likelihood of receiving credit ratings. As a result, indexed firms benefit from more liquid bond markets and lower yield spreads, prompting greater reliance on public debt. Consistent with an information-driven mechanism, leverage responses are strongest in countries with weaker information environments. However, these information gains do not enhance stock price informativeness: bid-ask spreads, price impact measures, post-earnings announcement drift, and the implied cost of equity remain unchanged—likely because of the growing presence of information-insensitive passive investors."
Use and Design of Peer Evaluations for Bonus Allocations,MANUEL GRIEDER,25 June 2025,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12628,"ABSTRACTWe conduct an experiment to investigate the use of peer evaluations for compensation purposes. Although organizations often rely on peer evaluations for incentive compensation, it is not well understood how peer feedback should be used and designed to ensure non-distorted evaluations and motivate effort provision. We study peer evaluations in form of bonus allocation proposals, thereby enabling a quantifiable test of our hypothesis. We distinguish between discretionary use (i.e., allocation by the manager) and formulaic use (i.e., allocation by the team via the average) of self-including and self-excluding proposals. We find that, relative to self-including proposals, self-excluding proposals are less distorted, irrespective of use, but lead to more effort provision only under formulaic use. Under discretionary use, the benefits of self-excluding proposals are offset, as managerial biases enter bonus allocations. In sum, our findings illustrate benefits of delegating bonus allocations to teams through formulaic use of self-excluding peer evaluations and extend the understanding of how organizations can effectively incorporate peer evaluations into incentive compensation."
Racial Disparities in Financial Complaints and the Role of Corporate Social Attitudes,RACHEL M. HAYES,17 March 2025,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12612,"ABSTRACTUsing consumer complaints filed with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as a measure for the quality of financial products and services, we present evidence of racial disparities in the service quality received by consumers. Consumers in high-minority communities file more complaints than those in low-minority communities, and the racial gap in financial complaints increased by more than 60% during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using a triple-difference approach, we establish the role of corporate social attitudes, reflected in, for example, inclusive promotion practices and diversity in leadership, in mitigating the complaint racial gap and its pandemic-period increase. Our results shed light on how inclusive corporate culture filters through an organization to benefit minority communities and underscore the effect of corporate social attitudes on important stakeholder outcomes."
Upward Influencers in Teams,Wei Cai,07 February 2025,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12601,"ABSTRACTUpward influencers, employees who are more favorably perceived by their supervisors than their peers and subordinates, are predicted by economic and accounting theories and are found to be ubiquitous in many organizations. Despite their prevalence, the role of upward influencers in teams remains underexplored. This paper fills this void by using proprietary data from a service-providing organization that allows for the identification of upward influencers based on its 360-degree person evaluation. We find an inverted U-shaped relationship between the fraction of upward influencers in a team and team performance. In cross-sectional analyses, we show that this relationship is driven by conditions when the need for collaboration and information sharing is high and when managers are less experienced. Additional tests exploring the mechanisms for the role of upward influencers in teams suggest that they impair team horizontal relationships through lowering the willingness to communicate, share knowledge, and offer mutual assistance among team members. Yet, teams with upward influencers build better vertical relationships with supervisors, which, in return, is associated with supervisors allocating more of their time to provide team members with feedback and guidance. Taken together, this study contributes to the understanding of upward influencers in teams."
Accounting Information Usage and Trading by Retail Investors: Evidence from Integrated Trading Platform,JACKY CHAU,17 March 2025,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12606,"ABSTRACTThis registered report investigates self-directed retail investors' information choices and trading decisions on an integrated trading platform that provides timely and convenient access to accounting information. The analyses reveal that these investors access a mosaic of information, with a high proportion not firm-specific. In accessing accounting disclosures, retail investors are more interested in media articles providing summaries or expert analyses than original filings. Retail trades on this integrated trading platform are more informed than another retail trading platform providing little information services while exhibiting no significant differences in informativeness compared with institutional trades usingBulge Bracketplatforms. In particular, trade informativeness is more pronounced when there are accounting disclosures. The evidence suggests that self-directed retail investors can benefit from a trading environment that provides rich and convenient access to a mosaic of information, particularly timely accounting disclosures."
"Limits to Political Capture: Evidence from Patent Grants, Disclosures, and Litigation",CHRISTINE CUNY,19 March 2025,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12607,"ABSTRACTSubstantial evidence suggests that regulatory agencies in the United States can be captured by the politicians who oversee them. We provide novel evidence of a federal agency in which capture is limited: the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Although patent applications from politically connected applicants are slightly more likely to be approved despite being of lower ex post quality, additional analyses suggest these outcomes are not indicative of capture. In particular, the disclosure quality of connected patents' legal claims increases more than unconnected patents during the review process, narrowing the scope of the patents and constraining the intellectual property rights. Furthermore, connected patents are no more likely than others to be litigated ex post, suggesting these patent grants are not spurious. Our findings provide insights into how the design of a regulator can limit the benefits that accrue to politically connected firms."
Consequences for Culpable Auditors,Jagan Krishnan,09 April 2025,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12608,"ABSTRACTWe present the first comprehensive descriptive evidence on the labor market and personal consequences for audit professionals in the United States who are named in SEC or PCAOB enforcement actions. Three key findings emerge. First, between 38% and 73% of culpable auditors depart from their firms within one year after the enforcement event. These departure rates are three to four times higher compared with a sample of non-culpable auditors. Second, 83% of culpable auditors departing from Big 4 accounting firms exit the profession, compared with 58% of a departing non-culpable comparison group. In contrast, about 77% of the culpable auditors leaving non–Big 4 accounting firms remain in public accounting, compared with 51% of a departing non-culpable comparison group. Third, using novel data on personal real estate holdings, we find that culpable auditors do not appear to engage in markedly different transactions around enforcement compared with a comparison sample of non-culpable individuals."
"Dynamic Information Acquisition, Investment, and Disclosure",SEUNG Y. LEE,17 March 2025,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12610,"ABSTRACTWe present a dynamic model of information acquisition and disclosure. The manager seeks to maximize future stock prices and collects information privately about the firm's fundamentals. Information acquisition increases the arrival rate of private information. The manager can choose to disclose his private information or withhold it in perpetuity. We study the impact of information acquisition on the accumulation of private information, disclosure, and the firm's initial investment."
The Spillover Effect of Liquidity Transparency on Liquidity Holdings,YAO LU,27 February 2025,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12602,"ABSTRACTI study how the disclosure of the liquidity coverage ratio mandated for a group of systemically important U.S. banks affects peer banks' liquidity holdings. I predict that the disclosure mitigates uncertainty about aggregate liquidity risk by providing insight into the likelihood of market-wide liquidity shocks and specific sources of liquidity stress. This uncertainty resolution, in turn, reduces nondisclosing banks' precautionary demand for liquidity. Using bank business interactions to measure the treatment intensity of the disclosure, I find that more treated nondisclosing banks cut their liquidity significantly more in response to the disclosure. In addition, the disclosure rule was followed by lower overall liquidity and a build-up of systemic risk, indicating an economically considerable disclosure spillover effect in the aggregate. My paper reveals a new economic force, the spillover effect of mandated liquidity disclosure, that shapes banks' liquidity holdings."
Public Disclosure of Private Meetings: Does Observing Peers’ Information Acquisition Affect Analysts’ Attention Allocation?,Yi Ru,03 March 2025,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12603,"ABSTRACTWe investigate the impact of observing peers’ information acquisition on financial analysts’ allocation of attention. Using the timely disclosure mandate by the Shenzhen Stock Exchange as a setting, we find that, shortly after analysts observe that a firm has been visited by peer analysts, they reduce short-term attention to that firm, as indicated by a reduced tendency to conduct follow-up visits. Nonvisiting analysts who do not conduct follow-up visits are more likely to discontinue coverage of the visited firm. These findings are consistent with the conjecture that the timely disclosure reveals the first-mover advantage of visiting analysts, leading nonvisiting ones to reallocate their limited attention. We also find that, compared with the pre-mandate period, the information environments of visited firms deteriorate immediately after an analyst's visit but not over the longer term. Further evidence suggests that the timely disclosure mandate has positive externalities in the form of increased immediate attention to and improved short-term information environments of unvisited peer firms."
Offshore Shared Services Center Usage by U.S. Big 4 Audit Engagement Teams,MATTHEW G. SHERWOOD,02 April 2025,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12611,"ABSTRACTAuditors frequently outsource audit work to offshore Shared Service Centers (SSCs) to reduce costs and ease the workload burdens of audit team members. However, concerns persist about whether these benefits come at the expense of audit quality. Using proprietary audit engagement-level data, I evaluate whether greater SSC usage by Big 4 audit teams has an association with either, or both, audit quality and audit costs. I find that SSC usage is nearly universal in Big 4 audits, with the percentage of audit hours SSCs perform increasing in recent years. Consistent with the audit firm's objectives, evidence suggests that SSC usage is associated with fewer audit hours and lower audit fees. Importantly, I find no evidence that SSC usage is associated with lower audit quality. Overall, results suggest that SSCs have the intended effect of reducing audit costs without sacrificing audit quality."
Strategic Scientific Disclosure: Evidence from the Leahy–Smith America Invents Act,KRISTEN VALENTINE,12 March 2025,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12605,"ABSTRACTWe examine the impact of technological competition on voluntary innovation disclosure around the enactment of the Leahy–Smith America Invents Act of 2011 (“AIA”). The AIA moves the US patent system from the first-to-invent to first-inventor-to-file system and induces a patent race that increases technological competition. Firms that are slow to file a patent are disadvantaged in this race. We find that focal firms with lagging patent classes strategically increase scientific publications in their lagging technology areas in an attempt to block competitors from obtaining a patent. This effect is more pronounced in technology areas where the firm has better information about their relative competitive position (proxied by greater inventor mobility), in technology classes with constraints on increasing patent filing timeliness (proxied by fewer experienced attorneys), and areas characterized by more intense competition. We find that the peers of firms with lagging classes experience greater patent filing rejections for lack of novelty and obviousness reasons after the AIA, suggesting that strategic scientific disclosure is effective."
Measuring Greenhouse Gas Emissions: What Are the Costs and Benefits?,LUCAS MAHIEUX,26 March 2025,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12613,"ABSTRACTWe adopt a financial-materiality approach in studying the costs and benefits of measuring greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions on social welfare. Production by firms internally generates direct GHG emissions (Scope 1 emissions) whereas outsourcing to suppliers generates indirect emissions (Scope 3 emissions). Our analysis incorporates two frictions: (1) long-term negative environmental externalities caused by emissions and (2) fragmentation in regulating emissions disclosures across jurisdictions. We show firms' failure to internalize the environmental externalities provides a rationale for mandating Scopes 1 and 3 emissions disclosures. However, such disclosures induce emissions leakage. Disciplining emissions leakage calls for setting complementary—rather than independent—disclosure requirements for Scopes 1 and 3 emissions. Our analysis underscores the importance of improving the reliability of Scope 3 emissions measurements given that measurements of Scope 1 emissions are highly reliable for public firms in Europe and the United States. Regulators can further enhance the disciplinary effects of Scope 3 emission measurements by requiring the allocations of Scope 3 emissions in supply chains to individual firms, especially when allocating Scope 3 emissions is more reliable, and for firms/industries that are more prone to transition climate risk relative to physical climate risk."
The Effect of Intangible Asset Classification on Professional Financial Statement Users’ Assessments,Spencer B. Anderson,04 March 2025,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12604,"ABSTRACTClassification of financial statement elements into categories is an inherent, integral part of the financial reporting system. Although prior research documents that categories influence users’ perceptions of included items, we explore the reverse effect—how classifying items in a category can impact perceptions of the category itself and its other members. Using categorization theory from psychology and accounting literature and exploiting the classification challenges inherent to the crypto asset setting, we predict and find that classifying individual items into a category can impact equity analysts’ perceptions of the category itself and perceptions of the category's other members. We also explore the boundaries of this effect and find that categories like intangibles, with fewer common prototypical features, are more susceptible to these classification effects. Our results show several ways in which balance sheet classification could lead to unintended consequences for users."
Accounting for Goodwill,STEFAN J. HUBER,18 April 2025,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12618,"ABSTRACTA significant portion of a merger's purchase price is allocated to goodwill. Currently, goodwill is not amortized but rather tested annually for impairment. When managers of acquiring firms care about earnings, goodwill's accounting treatment can have large effects on future earnings and may influence how much a manager will bid for a target company. We quantify the effects of goodwill accounting by estimating a structural model of corporate takeovers. Our estimates suggest accrual accounting increases buyout premia by an average of approximately 11 percentage points. If firms needed to amortize goodwill over 10 years, we estimate premia would reduce by 4.9 percentage points and M&A volume would shrink by 4.1% or $67 billion per year. Furthermore, the fraction of private equity acquirers would increase by 6.9 percentage points, shifting control over productive assets to the private and financial sector. Our results suggest the accounting treatment for goodwill has a meaningful effect on the market for corporate control."
Short Squeezes After Short-Selling Attacks,LORIEN STICE-LAWRENCE,06 January 2025,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12595,"ABSTRACTWe estimate the prevalence and drivers of short squeezes after short-selling attacks. Positive returns after attacks have a disproportionate tendency to fully reverse and are accompanied by heightened short covering, consistent with the presence of short squeezes. We assess and find no support for non-squeeze drivers of these positive return reversals and show they are more likely to be accompanied by squeeze-related news articles, increased stock volatility, and disruptions in the stock lending market. Using positive return reversals as a proxy for short squeezes, we estimate that 15% of short attacks experience squeezes, and squeeze risk increases with short sellers’ visibility but decreases with the credibility of their evidence. Additionally, squeezes appear to be precipitated by actions of firms and investors, including insider purchases, share recalls, retail investor trading, and firm disclosures. Our findings quantify a material risk and check on activist short selling and are especially timely given recent proposed short-selling restrictions."
Common Investor Relations Representation,DAVID VOLANT,14 April 2025,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12619,"ABSTRACTThis study examines the capital market implications of common investor relations (IR) representation, a phenomenon in which multiple public firms share the same external IR representative. Using a difference-in-differences research design, I document that common IR representation is associated with greater overlap in institutional ownership and sell-side analyst coverage as well as similarities in disclosure practices among clients—even those operating in different industries. These effects culminate in heightened return comovement among firms sharing IR representation. My findings provide insight into the role of IR companies as capital market gatekeepers and suggest that when a firm outsources its IR function, the IR company influences its capital market connectivity."
Tax Subsidy Disclosure and Local Economic Effects,LISA DE SIMONE,11 December 2024,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12591,"ABSTRACTWe examine if the effectiveness of business tax subsidies varies based on state disclosure laws. The prior accounting literature on government disclosure documents substantial variation in the quality of such disclosures, raising questions about their effectiveness for monitoring. State and local business subsidies for investment and employment have tripled in size over the past 30 years, but transparency problems inhibit clear assessments of whether subsidies achieve their intended outcomes. We examine both internal disclosure laws, which mandate subsidy reporting by the granting state agency to other state oversight agencies, and external disclosure laws, which mandate reporting to the public. We find positive effects of subsidies on local employment when subsidies are subject to internal disclosure laws; by implementing such regimes, governments could forego 1.2–1.7 subsequent subsidies per county, saving $419.0–$593.5 million in aggregate. In contrast, we observe little effect of external disclosure, which we show is due to governments either substituting to other types of incentives or posting stale information that impedes public monitoring. We contribute to the government disclosure literature by demonstrating the real employment effects of internal government disclosures, and we provide policy-relevant evidence about the conditions under which external disclosure regimes facilitate public monitoring."
Internalizing Peer Firm Product Market Concerns: Supply Chain Relations and M&A Activity,FARZANA AFRIN,16 September 2024,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12574,"ABSTRACTWe explore whether firms internalize the product market concerns of their economically linked peers by examining merger and acquisition decisions in the context of customer–supplier relations. Given the extensive transfer of capital, knowledge, and information between merging parties, we hypothesize that customers’ competition concerns discourage their suppliers from engaging in vertically conflicted transactions (i.e., acquisitions of their customers’ rivals or suppliers to those rivals). Consistent with our hypothesis, we find that suppliers are less likely to engage in such transactions when their customers are subject to higher product market competition. Moreover, the effect is more pronounced when suppliers and customers have greater relationship-specific investments and when customers face heightened proprietary information concerns. Using plausibly exogenous variation in common ownership between customers and their rivals as a shock to customers’ competition concerns, we conclude that the link between customers’ competition concerns and supplier acquisitions is likely causal. Our findings suggest that firms alter their investment and strategic decisions in response to the product market competition concerns of their economically related peers."
What Happens to Partners Who Issue Adverse Internal Control Opinions?,ASHLEIGH L. BAKKE,06 January 2025,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12597,"ABSTRACTWe investigate how audit firms balance the tension between professional responsibility and client service by examining changes in partner assignments following adverse internal control opinions (ICOs). We find that partners are significantly more likely to be reassigned when they issued an adverse ICO to any of their clients in the previous year. Further, partners issuing adverse ICOs experience unfavorable changes in their client portfolios in the form of lower fees and less prestigious assignments. We find that consequences are more negative when adverse ICOs are issued to clients that are more important to the local office and that there are no consequences when partners issue continuing adverse opinions to clients they have “inherited” from an original adverse ICO partner. We also find that the consequences are stronger for partners of non-Big 4 audit firms that are likely to be more sensitive to client service considerations. The negative portfolio effects we observe persist for at least three years, and our findings are robust to restrictions involving mandatory partner rotation and adverse ICOs that lead to client loss. Overall, our results are consistent with adverse ICO partners experiencing negative consequences as audit firms respond to client service incentives in the area of internal controls over financial reporting."
Silent Suffering: Using Machine Learning to Measure CEO Depression,SUNG-YUAN (MARK) CHENG,08 January 2025,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12590,"ABSTRACTWe introduce a novel measure of CEO depression by applying machine learning models that analyze vocal acoustic features from CEOs' conference call recordings. Our research was preregistered via theJournal of Accounting Research's registration-based editorial process. In this study, we validate this measure and examine associated factors. We find that greater firm risk is positively associated with CEO depression, whereas higher job demands are negatively associated with CEO depression. Female and older CEOs show a lower likelihood of depression. Using this novel measure, we then explore the relationship between CEO depression and career outcomes. Although we do not find any evidence that CEO depression is associated with CEO turnover, we find some evidence that turnover-performance sensitivity is higher among depressed CEOs. We also find limited evidence of higher compensation and higher pay-performance sensitivity for depressed CEOs. This study provides new insights into the relationship between CEO mental health and career outcomes."
Spillover Effects of the SEC's Regulatory Oversight on Private Debt Contracting: Evidence from Cross-listed Foreign Firms,Mahfuz Chy,11 November 2024,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12585,"ABSTRACTWe examine the effect of the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) regulatory oversight on private debt contracting outcomes, using the signing of the multilateral memorandum of understanding (MMoU) as a natural experiment. The MMoU enables the SEC to take stricter punitive actions against wealth expropriation by cross-listed firms’ insiders and enforce better compliance with applicable rules and regulations. We find that enhanced SEC oversight in the post-MMoU regime lowers loan spreads by 36 basis points, thus saving an average cross-listed firm approximately $9 million in direct loan costs over the life of a bank loan. Cross-sectional analyses show that the effect is more pronounced for borrowers from countries with weaker institutions, borrowers with greater accounting discretion, and for loans arranged by top lenders or loans not secured by collateral. Conversely, the effect is less pronounced for borrowers who use IFRS or when the SEC faces greater budgetary constraints. Enhanced SEC oversight also leads to an increase in loan maturity and a decrease in financial covenants. Our evidence suggests that while the SEC's primary mandate is to protect public equity and bond investors, its supervision yields substantial borrowing cost savings and more lenient nonprice loan terms in the private debt markets as well."
Redaction as Cross-Regulatory Disclosure Avoidance,IOANNIS V. FLOROS,09 January 2025,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12596,"ABSTRACTWe introduce the idea of cross-regulatory disclosure avoidance, whereby firms attempt to counteract expansions of disclosure under one regulation through actions that reduce disclosure under a different one. We study whether firms redact information from material contracts when they face new rules to disclose segment information. Using SFAS No. 131 as a plausibly exogenous shock to segment disclosure, we find that firms increasing the number of reported segments after the rule change exhibit a greater increase in redaction than firms maintaining the same number of segments. Consistent with proprietary cost motives, the increases are concentrated among firms with greater divergence in profitability across segments, higher abnormal segment profitability, and more negative abnormal stock returns in response to the finalization of the rule. Also, treated firms that redact after the rule change have abnormally profitable segments that they previously did not disclose. Firms that observables predict would increase redaction but did not experience declines in sales growth and profit margin. We find no evidence that agency cost motives drive the increases in redaction or, more generally, nondisclosure of segment performance before SFAS No. 131."
Financial Reporting Around Private Firms' Securities Offerings,YIRAN KANG,16 January 2025,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12598,"ABSTRACTThis paper investigates how U.S. private firms communicate with investors around private securities offerings. Using multiple research methods including survey, interview, and archival analysis, I provide systematic evidence on private firms' public and private disclosure practices. I find that despite engaging in a low level of public disclosures, private firms actively communicate with investors through private communication channels, with notable variation across firms in terms of content and frequency. Consistent with managers providing relevant information, financial information is disclosed when it is particularly useful for investors' decision-making. Furthermore, I explore the relation between private communication and public disclosure preferences and find a substitutive effect, suggesting that private firms may strategically manage communication channels to effectively engage with investors. This study contributes to the literature by describing the existing disclosure landscape of private firms."
Does Access to Patent Information Help Technological Acquisitions? Evidence from Patent Library Openings,CONNIE X. MAO,13 December 2024,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12592,"ABSTRACTTechnology acquirers face significant information asymmetry when identifying appropriate acquisition targets. We exploit plausibly exogenous variation in the costs of gathering technological information as the result of patent library openings. We find that, after local patent libraries open, firms become more active in technological acquisitions, acquirers prefer targets that are geographically or technologically close to a lesser extent, completion rates for technology M&A increase, and performance improves. Post-merger innovation output is enhanced through more collaboration between inventors of acquirers and their targets. Overall, our study sheds new light on the importance of information-gathering costs in corporate takeovers and on the search for human capital synergies."
The Effect of U.S. Country-by-Country Reporting on U.S. Multinationals’ Tax-Motivated Income Shifting and Real Activities,MICHELLE L. NESSA,06 January 2025,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12594,"ABSTRACTThe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development introduced country-by-country reporting (CbCR) for multinational enterprises (MNEs) to help tax authorities combat tax-motivated income shifting. This study uses confidential U.S. tax administrative data from 2011 to 2018 to examine the effect of U.S. CbCR adoption on the tax-motivated income shifting and real activities of U.S. MNEs. We first document that while U.S. CbCR provides the Internal Revenue Service with incremental information about the location of U.S. MNEs’ global activities relative to existing U.S. tax return disclosures, substantial overlap exists between U.S. CbCR and existing disclosures. In contrast with prior CbCR studies in cross-country settings, we fail to find evidence of a change in U.S. MNEs’ tax-motivated income shifting or a reallocation of real activities based on tax incentives in response to U.S. CbCR using multiple empirical approaches. Overall, our study leverages U.S. tax administrative data to provide insights into the impact of the CbCR initiative on U.S. MNEs."
How Does Judges’ Personal Exposure to Financial Fraud Affect White-Collar Sentencing?,TRUNG NGUYEN,22 October 2024,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12584,"ABSTRACTWe study whether federal judges’personalexposure to financial fraud affects theirprofessionalbehavior, in the form of sentencing outcomes in white-collar cases. Following the methodology outlined in our registered report, we construct a novel measure of financial fraud exposure based on judges’ direct shareholdings in firms that commit financial fraud. Using this measure, we exploit the random assignment of cases to judges to examine whether judges exposed to fraud in one firm are (1) less likely to rule in favor of defendants in white-collar cases involving other firms and (2) less likely to grant favorable pretrial motions to defendants. We find minimal evidence in support of either (1) or (2), concluding that for all but the most serious frauds, judges are unlikely to let their personal victimhood experience affect their professional sentencing behavior with respect to related cases. Our study broadens our understanding of the spillover effects of financial fraud enforcement and contributes to the literature on how judges’ personal experiences can shape judicial decision-making."
Correction to “How Does Financial-Reporting Regulation Affect Industry-Wide Resource Allocation?”,Matthias Breuer,14 March 2025,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12609,"ABSTRACTThis correction describes errors in the program code of Breuer [2021] and presents revised results. The errors affect the construction of the standardized reporting and auditing scopes, the treatment variables of the primary research design in Breuer [2021]. The revised results show weaker evidence that reporting mandates facilitate ownership dispersion in capital markets compared to Breuer [2021]. They also show weaker evidence that reporting mandates spur competition in product markets, including mixed evidence on product-market entry. Consistent with Breuer [2021], the revised results continue to show no unambiguous evidence that reporting mandates improve the efficiency of industry-wide resource allocation. With respect to audit mandates, the revised results continue to show evidence that the mandates impose a barrier to entry. Overall, the correction indicates that the impacts of reporting and auditing mandates are even more uncertain than reported in Breuer [2021] and that further research on these impacts is called for."
"Disclosure, Patenting, and Trade Secrecy",ARNOUD BOOT,22 October 2024,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12580,"AbstractPatent applications often reveal proprietary information to competitors, but does such disclosure harm firms or also benefit them? We develop and empirically support a theory showing that when firms patent enhancements to incumbent, nondisruptive technologies, they can cooperate more easily on these technologies, increasing their profitability. The downside of cooperating on nondisruptive technologies is that the investment in and commitment to disruptive technologies decline. To improve their commitment to disruptive technologies, some firms rely more on trade secrecy. We provide empirical support for these predictions. We document that after a patent reform that made information about patent applications widely accessible, firms cooperate more and charge higher markups. Furthermore, the nature of patented innovation has changed, with the proportion of nondisruptive patents increasing substantially. Finally, while some firms start patenting more, others patent less and rely more on trade secrecy, with the response depending on the attractiveness of firms' innovation prospects."
Court Disclosures of Firms in Chapter 11 Bankruptcy,Ilona Bastiaansen,25 September 2024,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12576,ABSTRACTStakeholders in the Chapter 11 reorganization process face significant information uncertainty about the post-emergence prospects of the firm. The U.S. Bankruptcy Code requires a debtor to provide a disclosure statement containing “adequate information” about its financial status and a proposed reorganization plan but stops short of rigidly defining the adequacy standard. We document the heterogeneity in disclosure statement information across 16 distinct attributes and examine the variation in disclosures along several dimensions that reflect agency costs and coordination problems. We observe that Chapter 11 disclosure correlates more with claimant- and case-specific characteristics than pre-bankruptcy debtor characteristics. Our results illustrate the importance of institutional features in specific disclosure settings such as bankruptcy court filings. The research questions and methods of this study were registered via theJournal of Accounting Research’s registration-based editorial process.
Measuring the Prevalence of Earnings Manipulations: A Novel Approach,NICOLE L. CADE,08 October 2024,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12578,"ABSTRACTWe provide prevalence estimates for five forms of earnings manipulation based on executives’ reports about their firms’ actual reporting practices. After preregistering our methods and analyses via theJournal of Accounting Research’s registration-based editorial process, we recruit nearly a thousand executives from firms listed in the Russell 3000 Index to participate in either a survey or a list experiment; the hallmark of the latter being additional privacy protections designed to promote honest disclosure about self-incriminating information. In our survey, 26.8% of executives disclose at least one form of earnings manipulation at their firm in the 2018–2023 period: 18.0% report changing an operational activity to meet a near-term earnings target at the expense of long-term value (i.e., real earnings management), 8.8% report intentionally obfuscating unfavorable information, 6.6% report manipulating accruals, 3.9% report withholding material information, and 0.0% report accounting fraud. Our list experiment produces an economically higher result in two cases, estimating that 29.9% of firms engaged in real earnings management and 12.4% committed accounting fraud over the same time period. We conclude that while a traditional survey can provide credible lower-bound estimates for the prevalence of many forms of earnings manipulation, list experiments encourage more honest disclosure in some cases."
Discontinuous Distribution of Test Statistics Around Significance Thresholds in Empirical Accounting Studies,XIN CHANG,30 September 2024,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12579,"ABSTRACTExamining test statistics from articles in six leading accounting journals, we detect discontinuities in their distributions around conventional significance thresholds (p-values of 0.05 and 0.01) and find an unusual abundance of test statistics that are just significant. Further analysis reveals that these discontinuities are more prominent in studies with smaller samples and are more salient in experimental than in archival studies. The discontinuity discrepancy between experimental and archival studies relates to several proxies for researcher degrees of freedom. Nevertheless, this evidence does not imply that experimental research is more prone to questionable research practices than archival studies. Overall, our findings speak to the concern of whether accounting researchers could exercise undisclosed discretion to obtain and report statistically significant results. Based on our results, a healthy skepticism of some just-significant test statistics is warranted."
The Decision Relevance of Loan Fair Values for Depositors,QI CHEN,11 July 2024,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12564,"ABSTRACTUsing a large sample of U.S. commercial banks from 1994 to 2019, we find that loan fair values are highly relevant for depositor decision making. A one-standard-deviation decrease in loan fair value performance is associated with more than 10% lower uninsured deposit flows than the sample average. Information in fair values about loan credit quality is quite limited and cannot account for the bulk of the relevance. Instead, consistent with models of bank fragility, the relevance seems to stem more from information on the decline in loan liquidation values, triggering panic-based withdrawals motivated by (self-fulfilling) expectations of withdrawals by other depositors. The findings inform the cost-benefit tradeoff of reporting loan fair values."
"Where Does the Time Go? Auditors’ Commercial Effort, Professional Effort, and Audit Quality",WILLIAM A. CICONTE,17 August 2024,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12569,"ABSTRACTAudit theory and regulation assumes that auditors’ commercial motivation threatens audit quality. In this registered report, we use data from two Big Four firms in the Netherlands and provide empirical evidence on the relation between auditors’ commercial motivation and (1) compensation, (2) total audit effort, and (3) audit quality. We proxy commercial motivation as the time that individual auditors report allocating to commercial activities. We hypothesize that auditors’ commercial effort is positively related to compensation and we find mixed support. Next, we hypothesize that auditors’ commercial effort is negatively related to the audit effort but we find no support. Turning to audit quality, we hypothesize a negativedirectrelation between auditors’ commercial effort and audit quality but we find no support. We also predict a positiveindirectrelation in which auditors’ commercial effort increases quality control reliance leading to higher audit quality. We find some support for this hypothesis but only when we use technical consultations to proxy for quality control. Auditors with greater commercial effort maintain quality because they rely more on technical consultations. In sum, our study challenges the assumption that auditors’ commercial effort threatens audit quality and questions the need for additional regulation to constrain commercial motivation."
Information Spillovers at Earnings Announcements,RICHARD FRANKEL,25 June 2024,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12562,"ABSTRACTResearch documents price co-movements, or “spillovers,” between focal firms and their peers at focal firms’ earnings announcements. We find that both signed and absolute co-movements between focal- and peer-firm returns are significantly lower at earnings-announcement dates compared to other dates. Analytically, we demonstrate that co-movements do not necessarily indicate common information; instead, co-movements measure the relative proportion of focal firm-specific information to common information in focal-firm earnings announcements. We study three settings where information transfers might be higher: when focal firms report significant earnings surprises, are industry leaders, or share correlated earnings patterns with peer firms. We continue to find lower return correlations during focal-firm earnings announcements. We conduct two alternative tests but fail to find evidence that common information released during focal-firm earnings announcements is significantly greater than on other days. These results raise doubt about the extent of the information externality attributable to financial-report releases."
Tax Policy Expectations and Investment,John Gallemore,25 September 2024,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12577,"ABSTRACTThis paper examines how firms’ tax policy expectations (TPE) evolve around and relate to their investment responses to changes in tax policy. Using a text-based approach to measuring TPE, we find that two recent tax policy–changing events—namely, the 2016 U.S. presidential election and the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA)—spawned considerable between- and within-firm variation in TPE, with aggregate time-series patterns in TPE occasionally challenging prevailing assumptions in previous research. Further, we observe that event-induced TPE relate to investment both before and in response to the TCJA's passage in 2017, with offsetting associations between its first and second moments, and that these TPE moderate the TCJA's intended investment-stimulating effect. Furthermore, we document a difference between domestic and multinational firms in their TPE-investment response, with the former (latter) more likely to adjust the level (shift the country location) of their investment. Overall, our findings support the idea that TPE can impact investment behavior in the face of a tax policy change and suggest that our methodology can be used by future research to incorporate TPE into analyses of tax policy effects."
Financial Transparency of Private Firms: Evidence from a Randomized Field Experiment,JOACHIM GASSEN,03 September 2024,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12568,"ABSTRACTThis paper examines why private firms choose to be financially transparent or opaque by conducting a field experiment with more than 25,000 firms in Germany. We inform a randomly chosen set of firms about a disclosure option that allows eligible firms to restrict access to their otherwise publicly available financial statements. We also vary the messaging in subtle ways to induce experimental variation in the probability that firms take transacting (capital providers or customers and suppliers) versus non-transacting stakeholders (competitors or general interest parties) into consideration when making their filing decision. Based on each firm's actual filing decision, we find that treated firms are 15% more likely to restrict access to their financial statements. This intention-to-treat effect is persistent and concentrated among firms that should derive lower net benefits from disclosure (smaller, more mature firms in less capital-intensive industries). These findings indicate that informational constraints affect firms’ disclosure practice. Additionally, we show that the treatment effect is almost 40% larger for firms that have a higher, exogenously induced, probability of considering non-transacting stakeholders when making their disclosure decision. By analyzing subsequent firm activity and complementary survey evidence, we also provide suggestive evidence that disclosure requirements put an undue burden on very small private firms."
Just Friends? Managers’ Connections to Judges,STERLING HUANG,13 July 2024,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12563,"ABSTRACTWe study the impact of social connections between judges and executives on the outcomes of Securities Class Action Litigation (SCAL). Judges who are socially connected to a firm's executives are significantly more likely to dismiss lawsuits against the firm. There is also evidence of faster resolution and lower payout amounts in connected cases. The favorable outcomes cannot be explained by the lower severity of connected cases, or by court, judge, or firm characteristics. Our results are more pronounced when executives connected to the judge are named defendants in the lawsuits, when connected cases involve less visible lawsuits or firms, and when connections between judges and executives are likely more direct. Our evidence indicates that social connections influence judge impartiality and meaningfully alter SCAL outcomes."
The Effect of the Federal Judicial System on Public Enforcement: Evidence from SEC Enforcement Actions,YANRONG JIA,22 August 2024,Journal of Accounting Research,,/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12571,"ABSTRACTThis study examines whether the efficiency of federal district courts affects the likelihood of SEC enforcement. The results indicate that the SEC is less likely to initiate enforcement actions against firms in less efficient federal district courts. In addition, the study examines the implications of court efficiency for firms’ financial reporting quality (FRQ). The evidence suggests that firms residing in more efficient federal districts have higher FRQ and the effect is stronger in subsamples with weak private enforcement regimes. Additional analysis of the choice of venue suggests that the SEC's decision to file in the District Court for D.C. is not affected by local court efficiency. Collectively, this study highlights the importance of an efficient federal judicial system for public enforcement."
